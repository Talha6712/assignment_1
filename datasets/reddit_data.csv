How many of you guys actually made money with crypto?,"Crypto is depicted as a relatively ‚Äúeasy‚Äù way to make money. Obviously that isn‚Äôt really the true. I find it more like a lottery than a easy income source if you trade with altcoins. So how many of you guys actually 2x, 5x, 10x or even 100x your money in crypto? And how many of you actually lost money so far? Do you consider crypto as a good way of making money if you do it smartly? Do you feel like crypto is easier to make money with than some other maybe more traditional methods? Do you feel like you can keep getting consistent results if you know what you‚Äôre doing?",IDK-__-IDK,1729176156.0,879,CryptoCurrency

"Trump is NOT ""better"" for crypto.","There has been an overwhelming number of pro-Trump posts on this sub recently. All claiming that he is the god damned bitcoin messiah.

Is it because someone make NFTs out of a collection of AI generated images glorifying your saggy orange demi-god? (Newsflash, that was a grift. Another in his long line of grifts since the 80s.)

US crypto hodlers: You have about 2 weeks before the 1099-DA goes into effect.,"Just a friendly reminder:

Starting January 1st, 2025 (in 2 weeks), all US exchanges (e.g. Kraken, Coinbase) will start reporting your crypto transactions directly to the IRS via the [1099-DA](https://gordonlaw.com/learn/form-1099-da/).

For pretty much the entire existence of crypto so far, US users have had to self report crypto gains on their taxes (many didn't, or simply underreport). But if you have any sale transactions next year (2025) within the exchange of your choosing, they will automatically be reported to the IRS.

Especially noteworthy: If you have coins that you've held for a long time (e.g. from this year or before) and you sell them next year, the IRS will see that you have **$0 cost basis**. And you will have to show them when you acquired your coins (if it's been too long and you somehow can't find these transactions, then too bad, the IRS will just auto-calculate your cost basis as $0).

For example, if you held DOGE from 2020 and your cost basis is $0.002 (and DOGE is now $0.40), you'll have to provide the 2020 transaction where you bought DOGE for $0.002 and pay all the capital gains on the difference. Plus they'll likely audit your other trades from back then and bill you for any other unreported gains.

**TL;DR**: you have about 2 weeks to tidy up your books, lock in your gains, and make sure you have crypto and USD exactly where you want them to be when January 1st rolls around.",ADogeMiracle,1734404308.0,1652,CryptoCurrency

A brutal bear market left me with no income for almost a year until I managed to land another good job.

I‚Äôm sharing my story as a cautionary tale for anyone who might think crypto will pump forever or that they‚Äôre invincible as an investor. Stay grounded, stay humble, and don‚Äôt let the hype blind you.

Finding Out About Crypto Ruined My Life,"Let me preface this by saying that as someone with an engineering degree I‚Äôm a complete idiot. 

I learned about crypto while I was in college in 2017. Funny enough my classmate told me about bitcoin in 2015 when it was $400 and I laughed it off as broke college kid. Anyway, 2017, I became obsessed and I had my phase of telling everyone I knew about crypto and that they should buy.

I managed to turn a few hundred bucks into 10 grand. As someone who‚Äôs been a lazy procrastinator my whole life this new thing was my golden ticket out of needing to work ever again. Of course I didn‚Äôt sell anything before it disappeared.

By 2020 I had almost forgot about my bag. By 2021 I felt like a genius again and ‚Äúknew‚Äù I was right. I still never pulled out cash, if I sold, it was to buy other coins and you know how that went. It‚Äôs 2025 now and I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm tired of what crypto has done to my mental health. 

These crazy crypto swings have made it so I‚Äôm entirely not grounded with money. What‚Äôs $500 when we‚Äôre seeing $5k swings (and never selling, just eating poopoo). 

That‚Äôs not even the best part, because don‚Äôt forget as lazy person the idea of one day becoming a crypto millionaire (so hopeful) is a great way to kill your career ambitions. Now here we are, crypto is finally gaining some traction in the real world and I‚Äôm not a millionaire no where close, my job is shit, and I got a ton of debt. 

Don‚Äôt be like me. Don‚Äôt romanticize your gains. Work hard in your life as if crypto is going to zero. I‚Äôm sure many of you will think this nonsense doesn‚Äôt apply to you. It does. Anyway I welcome the chat to shit on my and/or make me feel better. Thanks. 


Edit: Bear with me I said I studied maths, I‚Äôm not a writer. I‚Äôm still in profit. I have a mains bag and a memes bag. I don‚Äôt blame crypto. I am blaming myself, my point was with my personality finding something like this was a bad bad thing for me. 

I didn‚Äôt even consider the market being a little down right now writing this post. It was more so the stress of things outside crypto and dwelling on how I got here that made me write this now. Those choices made it so my unrealized gains aren‚Äôt as life changing. Hopefully this helps some people from making the same wrong choices.

"I Took Out $94,000 in Personal Loans to Buy Crypto: 19 Month Update","Not financial advice. 

Greetings All,  

This is my 19 month update since I first took out an unsecured personal loan to buy Bitcoin. You can find my previous updates in my post history. The first is from June 2022. 

A lot has happened since my last update, so I‚Äôll get right to it‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

First off, I managed to completely pay off my 2nd loan of $20,000! 

Work has been better than usual and I had a big job in December that netted me a $12,000 windfall of which the entirety was put towards my loan balance.

Next I decided to buy even more Bitcoin by taking advantage of some really awesome Credit Card Balance Transfer offers that appeared in August/September‚Ä¶

Two of my credit cards were offering 0% APR for the first 18 and 21 months with a one time 3% and 5% transfer fee respectively. I also opened a new card that was offering a similar deal and was approved for a $12,000 limit. That combined with my previous two credit card brought my total to $40,000 in balance transfer potential. 

Balance transfer offers are great because they allow you to simply write a check to yourself and cash it in your bank account like any other check. Also, I‚Äôm only responsible to pay 1% each month, so servicing it is really easy. 

I ended up using $35,000 in balance transfer loans and buying 1.35 Bitcoin at an average price of \~$26,500. This brings my total amount of Bitcoin purchased with loans to 4 Bitcoin!!!!

**With the balance transfer monthly payments, plus the previous loans, my total monthly cost to service all these loans is \~$800.** 

I can easily afford this. In fact, I‚Äôm putting almost double that towards these loans each month to pay them down aggressively so I don‚Äôt end up paying a lot of interest when it‚Äôs all said and done. I plan to have everything paid off in less than two years. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**As of today, of the combined loans / balance transfers I have a total remaining balance of \~$56,000.**

It works out like this:

$21,000 remaining balance from unsecured personal loan.

$35,000 from new balance transfer loans. 

This brings the total amount of loans that I‚Äôve taken out so far to $94,000. I‚Äôve paid a total of \~$4,500 in interest to date, which brings the total cost basis of these loans to \~$98,500 as of January 24th, 2024.

**I have acquired a total of 4 Bitcoin at an average price of \~$24,625 per coin: $98,500 / 4 = $24,625.** 

**As of today, January 25th, 2024, the current price of Bitcoin is \~$40,000.**

**This brings the total value of the Bitcoin I acquired from loans to $160,000.**

**This represents an unrealized USD profit of \~$61,500.** 

The math is simple: $160,000 - $98,500 = $61,500

Lastly, I‚Äôm officially done taking out loans and balance transfers. I have a nice round number of Bitcoin from loans, plus my personal stack which I‚Äôve been slowly adding to from earned income. Now it‚Äôs time to focus on paying everything down over the next 2 years with earned income. I have no desire to sell my Bitcoin regardless of how high its price goes. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

"The market is crashing, and so is Crypto.","The harsh truth is, the Fed is tightening its monetary policies and they're going to be raising interest rates very soon. The inflation rate is now too much to ignore as the people realize that their buying power is deteriorating faster and faster with little being done about it. As money is harder to get with the Fed reducing its balance sheet, there will be less money to invest into Crypto and the market.

# The Crash Has Already Started

When the Fed announced it was going to be raising interest rates, I warned about a market crash in a post I made just 10 days ago. Unfortunately, the crash I was talking about has already started as the stock market has started going down very intensely.

[Nasdaq Index Falling](https://preview.redd.it/c1prsr60x0d81.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b0b9fcffc58081d9477139f54bf4334b97e94c3)

The pace at which the stock market is going down can very likely cause a situation like we've seen in 2008. This is going to cause panic and sell offs among people. We can already see people cashing out their stock market gains due to recent price action.

# Surging Inflation and Market Crash

If we see the history, every time there was high inflation, the Fed artificially triggered a market crash by aggressively increasing interest rates.

[Inflation and Interest rate correlation](https://preview.redd.it/wd2srkb9x0d81.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&s=628ff4587a8298793996352607cec9b84c928f16)

This rise in interest rate and the planned decrease of the Fed's balance sheet is going to have a severe impact on the market as people start borrowing less, spending less and investments into all assets start to dwindle.

# Biden Approval Rating

[Approval Ratings Fall Sharply Due To Inflation Concerns](https://preview.redd.it/tbvvccadx0d81.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=e10b55e73781fccb335a8fb7f7203a709023a84b)

With more and more inflation, people are losing trust in the Government and the approval rating is going down. The main reason behind this huge fall in approval rating is inflation, and the government needs to tackle inflation if they want to keep their approval rating from falling even lower as the public takes notice of their bills. The approval rating is a sign that the government needs to tackle inflation if it wants to keep public support.

# The Sell-off and the Opportunity

With the market crash ahead being very likely, people are taking their money out faster and faster. The Fed is no longer giving them free money very soon. The amount of people that are buying assets very low considering the current situation, and it is likely going to start going down as the interest rates are yet to be increased, which is when we will see the peak effects of the upcoming crash.

However, when crashes are at their peak, they leave most assets EXTREMELY undervalued. These are the times when you want to dump money into things like Crypto, which can rise extremely fast during a bullish market.

# Crypto's Correspondence With the Stock Market

The Cryptocurrency market is strongly correlated with the stock market, especially after more and more institutions have started to invest in Crypto. The Crypto market WILL react if there is a downtrend in the general economy. That is basically the reason we saw another dip in Crypto's prices today.

**TLDR**: The Fed will be tightening its monetary policies due to inflation and the stock market has started to crash. With the stock market starting to go down, we're already seeing the Crypto market react today, and unfortunately if the general market continues to dip, so will Crypto.",Many_Scratch2269,1642763475.0,10955,CryptoCurrency

I hope people can see whats happening with US based cryptos and Bitcoin,"Crypto investor since 2017, made good money, enough to quit my job in my mid 30s and travel and start a business and do other things I want with my life. Doesnt mean I know anything.

It is my belief that at some point, just like every other market, there will be a bust/selection period where 99% of projects become worthless. Of the remaining survivors, maybe 5-6 take up 80-85% of the market share, 5-6 take up 5-10% and the remaining hundreds or thousands of coins make up the last 5-10%

Example: Theres Verizon, Att, T mobile at the top, then theres tracfone and boost and mint mobile, then theres 100 that nobody knows anything about. There are 100s of brands of batteries but very few companies who actually make the batteries. Tons of tv companies, 5-6 that people know, dozens that we dont, 100s of other ones, and only a handful of huge manufacturers that make everyones tvs at the same place.

This is what will happen IMO because it always does, since forever.

And while I dont really care if youre a fan of the US or not, the US is the strongest economy in the world, and it is in the best position to harness this and benefit from it and control the direction of the space in the US and global narrative. Im not saying this is the best for crypto or the world, but I think it's ignorant to outright say it wont matter.

With the US and other countries getting on board with a strategic reserve, its clear bitcoin is and will continue to be a winner for the foreseeable future.

I believe this is also why we have the Dino/US coins pumping as their leaders have recently all been meeting together with some of them like Hoskinson even getting involved directly with legislators, meeting with senators, getting in front of congress and talking about what is best for us. Founders have all recently met, are all ISO 20022 compliant, and are all going nuts. I think this is a winning recipe for this cycle and for the future and I just want people to be aware of it. These projects **XLM XRP ADA HBAR ALGO** are outperforming a lot of other coins and I believe this is why, despite people starting to call them all irrelevant before this happened.

I am saying this because this is my third cycle in the space and have wasted time and money looking for pumpy coins when if I had just kept my money where I had it 7 years ago in these Dino coins (in XRP and ADA anyways), id have been proven right in my early conviction of these projects. Look at the narrative, research it, and make an educated guess. Do not ignore these trends and its ok to take risks on meme coins with a little bit of your portfolio but make sure you are on the right side of history when it all shakes out, because it will at some point in the not so distant future.",TheTreeOneFour,1732914715.0,1170,CryptoCurrency

"despite popular believe, crypto is not the best way to secure your financial future, getting a good job is","Users in this sub and other crypto subs have this mentality that crypto is the best and only opportunity they have to get ahead financially. This is ridiculous, getting a good job would be far more beneficial, especially if you have a shitty job and can't afford to buy much crypto in the first place. And if you are making 25-40k a year you shouldn't be spending huge chunks of your time looking into or researching crypto. There are people here that claim to have spent hundreds or even thousands of hours on research. And they admit they are also poor... 

Firstly, if you are poor it doesn't matter how much research you do, if you cant even afford to invest a grand you will never see returns that will even support you for one year. You are far better off spending the hundreds or thousands of hours learning tech that pays, like getting your ccna, or learning how to program or something like that. If you are really that into tech why haven't you done this? 

Secondly let's say you make 35k a year and decide to learn new skills and net a job that pays 75k a year. Your effort has awarded you an extra 40k a year. Crypto will never bring you those kinds of annual returns (unless you are a big player, but big players have good jobs), especially if you are poor (refer to previous paragraph).

I heard about this token a week ago and I went to do research. What I found? 1000x evidence that this was a scam, but I was intrigued.

I thought, let me put 10$ in this just for funnies. I got around 661 SQUID.

As the days went by, I started seeing it climb, 1$, 2$, 5$, 10$, 30$, and I was thinking... Imagine if I can take this money out. Of course I knew that I wouldn't ever take the money out, I was fully convinced of that, but it was fun to see it happen.

Couple of days later, I go to check the SQUID price and it's at 2000$. I was like wtf? 2000$ times 661 SQUID is 1.3 million dollars. I was a crypto millionaire.

5 minutes later it crashed down to nothing, but the 10$ wasn't for nothing.

I'm now able to say I was a crypto millionaire at some point of my life.

**REMINDER: Don't ever put money on scam coins, always do your research and be careful on what you invest. I was fully aware of this scam.**

EDIT: A lot of people been asking why didn't I sell at 1$ or 20$ or 100$. The reason I didn't sell it was because I couldn't sell. The liquidity pool was closed by the devs since the beginning, meaning that NO ONE could sell/swap their tokens for BNB or USDT or anything else. If I was able to sell I would have sold at 1$!

Everyone said they would love to buy their Crypto 80% more down. Now that it happened they are paralyzed out of fear instead.,"A throwback to maybe Oct/Nov of last year where Bitcoin was having its height of the run and everything seemed primed for 100k EOY. People were happy and euphoric. The only complaint and the big one was to have bought more. Then we go to end of Nov and the first people started calling for a 80% dip so that they can load up.

Where are those people now? Well they are probably too scared right now and the majority likely already left the market in January of this year or so. 

It's easy to call for a 80% dip but it's hard to stay for it. The dip won't be sharp down on one day and sharp up the next one. For most altcoins it will be a question of survival.",partymsl,1655064154.0,7867,CryptoCurrency
Elon Musk Just Embarrassed Himself In Front Of Crypto Twitter,"[Elon Musk Tweet](https://ibb.co/dBSg5ps)

On the Night of May 15th, a Twitter profile tweeted Doge Coin is the chosen one by Elon Musk because of its lower fees and less environmental effect.

Elon Musk replies that he wants to speed up Block time 10X and increase Block size 10X to reduce transaction fee 100X, for Doge Coin. 

If the solution of blockchain scaling was simply to change the variables, why Adam Beck didn't think of this and why Satoshi didn't think of this.

Even now projects like Ethereum can increase the limit and make transaction fees on the chain reduce over 1000X.

THE SOLUTION IS NOT TO JUST CHANGE NUMBERS.

It seriously has a bad effects on the network security and decentralization. (Please remember this)

Many projects like BCH and BSV has tried all this. And failed.

This narrative is so 2013.

Bitcoin has proven itself again and again over the years on why it is the King. And projects like Ethereum are working for years to scale in this perspective. 

If you are new to crypto, please do not get manipulated by Elon Musk's tweets. 

IMO, Doge Coin is just a tool for Elon to flex his dominance around this space. It won't last long as he clearly has no clue what he is talking about.",satoshinakamoto7,1621131741.0,16837,CryptoCurrency

"Introduced my friend to Crypto, Now he wont speak to me.","I knew a guy called John. me and him had been friends for a long time, nearly 10 years i think. i got into crypto a while back and i'd obviously talk about it with him, encourage him to start as it is a great hobby to have. John claimed he was too 'busy' to invest, i.e. playing video games all day and jacking off in his uni dorm room.

However, recently, John had a change of heart. he wanted to pull himself together and thought that crypto would be the catalyst so he came to me to learn. naturally i was ecstatic, this was one of my best friends and i really enjoy teaching people things. I taught John everything i knew, how to use exchanges, how to set up a wallet, how to spot good projects, the trends of the market etc.. i spent countless hours of my personal time helping him learn basic things (he is a bit slow).

Now, i warned John to steer clear of shitcoins. i told him that although you may get lucky and get rich quick, the chance of this happening is so low and newbies like him fall victim to these scams the most. he was very off put by this and assured me he would avoid them.

A few weeks go buy and i received a very long message from John. He told me he was quitting crypto and he had lost all of his savings he put in. i was shocked, but as i read the message it became clear to me what had happened. he said a youtuber had basically shilled him a 'low market cap' coin telling him he could 50x his money in a week. Yes, John fell victim to a pump and dump.

This is where it gets worse, i replied asking why would he do this when i advised him otherwise. i got no message back, i called him a few days after and to my shock the phone would instantly hang up. John blocked me on everything, not just phone but instagram, whatsapp, facebook. i was shocked and upset, i had done nothing wrong. i asked one of our mutual friends if i could speak to John, and he told me that John wanted nothing to do with me because i had made him lose all his money,

He didnt blame himself, or even the scammy youtuber, he blamed the person who introduced him to crypto and **warned** him of scams.

It really hurts writing this knowing ive lost someone i knew for 10 years over something i didn't even do. i just tried to help.

The moral of the story is don't advise people to get into crypto, or tell them what to invest in, friends or even family, because when shit goes south the first person they will blame is you.

edit: thanks for all the advice and support guys, ive changed my mind and im no longer sad about this. its better to get rid of people like this now than in the future.",HeungMinSwan,1623561255.0,15883,CryptoCurrency
This is how you make money with crypto,"I'm going to tell you the strategy that I used to go from 2k to 15k, and that I will start using again from now on since I got down to 8k from trying to do stupid leverage trades and using options:

Step 1: find a couple coins with good projects and fundamentals that you believe will be good in the furute, mines are ETH, DOT, MATIC, and SOL.

Step 2: send them to a wallet, write down the seed phrase in a piece of paper an store it somewhere safe.

Step 3: delete whatever trading app/website you are using, unsubscribe from al crypto news, forums and whatever, just cut all your connections with crypto and don't even look at the market.

Step 4: live happily for a couple years without worrying about your crypto or looking at them, do shit, have fun.

Step 5: after a couple years check how rich you are now and buy whatever the fuck you want.

The technology is good but aside from that it's an absolute shit coin, another ""ethereum killer"" that will probably die out once the biggest investors sell their bags. 

For starters how can the devs shut down the blockchain because of a glitch then call the platform decentralised? Do you think crypto could of ever come this far if satoshi shut down btc for repairs? Absolute nonsense.

Then there was the discovery of a hidden 12 million coins which wasint disclosed to any investor. 12,000,000√ó ¬£160 (roughly at the moment)= ¬£1,920,000,000 is a lot of money to hide for no specific reason.

Pornhub just saved a lot of my crypto,"So about 20 minutes ago, I got a ""hey, did you fly to Germany overnight?"" Unauthorized login email from pornhub. Checked it, sure enough someone logged in with my password. Don't give two shits about someone watching porn on my account, so I immediately went to work on the rest.

I don't share passwords with any accounts, but pornhub one was an oddly secure password that probably couldn't be brute forced... I assumed breach.

Changed all my exchange passwords that were tied to the same email, and switched all their 2fa to my phone instead of email. That's when I start getting login failure notices... Of course they hit the exchanges first.

After that I damage controlled financial institution accounts, and sure enough started seeing login failures on those. About 15 minutes after I got the pornhub notice (when serious damage would've already been done) I got a ""possible breach"" notification from capital one assistant.

I totally am usually asleep right now. Pornhub may have just saved me tens of thousands of dollars, and is apparently more reliable than all my financial institutions.

****Update and FAQ:

Thanks so much for the awards and responses! I just thought this was a funny near miss and wanted to share my maniacal laughter, had no idea it would blow up like this.

So, turns out it was my phone that was malware compromised. Factory reset, extended authy to everything for now, all passwords changed, all financial institutions alerted.

As has been pointed out a few times in comments, it's likely they accessed pornhub first because if I had linked crypto wallets or bank accounts for tipping, they could just send all meh money to their verified account. Probably a super easy front door way of scooping a couple BTC up from unwitting peoples... Hadn't thought of that, I just assumed they were testing access.

No, having a pornhub account doesn't mean I pay for porn, just that I like to save playlists and favorites. Some of you are living in the 90s of internet porn. 

Amazed at how many people assume that the breach came from pornhub. Frankly, it seems like they guard info better than anyone else I deal with. I would never think of putting personal information into any porn site... Pornhub's app has always proven to be secure and well supported.

All credit accounts frozen, all financial institutions contacted. Net loss of ZERO. They attempted a $7000 wire transfer out of my checking account that my small town bank ofc called me about, and a $1300 credit card purchase that got declined as sketch. Otherwise it seems I beat them to all accounts.

Since so many people are asking about my phone... It's an Android, brand new Motorola sealed in box.

"I've retired thanks to crypto, but there's something very few people think about or tell you: boredom hits hard","TL;DR: do not stop working/studying when/if you get rich through crypto (or by any other means). Set up your own business, study something you love or whatever. Just make sure your brain will keep doing some exercise and that you'll be part of some group/society.

Seeing so many posts about when lambo, when moon etc., I see myself a few years ago discovering that I could finally hasten by \~10 years my retirement (I'm in my 60's now). Damn, was I happy about that. I could finally erase all my debt, travel without worrying about days off being discounted of my paycheck, spend lots of time with my family and buy some of the stuff I've always wanted. In \~6 months my life changed really hard, and for the better! I gave my grand kids a nice trip do Disney and paid the wedding of my youngest daughter. Suddenly everything fit perfectly.

After 7-8 months, then, I got myself thinking like ""so... is this it?"". I was not happy anymore. Don't get me wrong: I wasn't *unhappy*, but I wasn't happy either. I would wake up everyday, go for a walk, pass by some bakery and buy some stuff, and get back home to surf on the web. I could of course travel to wherever I wanted, but what for? 

Friends came in asking for money and I never heard from them again. Some relatives thought I'd won the lottery and suddenly became extremely friendly and helpful, even though literally no one but my daughter and her husband were here at my wife's funeral. 

At the end, I've decided to go back to studying and finally entered college. It changed my way of perceiving the world and now I'm quite happy. I've also volunteered at some NGOs in my city and it helped me to keep my pace with society.

So my advice is that you need to get prepared to deal with boredom. We grow up with our parents telling us to go to school, have a job, a car, a house and that this is life. But when you suddenly have the car, the house and everything else, what's left? Do something for yourself and have this in mind. 

Boredom hits hard and you need to get prepared to deal with it.

Godspeed to you all!

The top rated post now is a post saying that banks consumed 520% more energy than bitcoin, even though the top comments are saying it's a bad argument, there still a lot of people who think the article is right, if you go on Twitter bitcoin maxis are always saying people are dumb because they don't get it how bitcoin is more efficient. Banks processed 200 billions of transactions last year against what, 200 million bitcoin transactions? You don't have to be a genius at math to see that there's no way bitcoin would win if it had the same amount of users and transactions. 

I'm not even getting into the argument that there are millions of people working for banks who likely would be working elsewhere and generating co2 emissions nevertheless. Those people work on different areas that you like it or not, are ""features"" bitcoin doesn't have, banks transaction output is not necessary related with their co2 emission because they do a lot more than sending money from A to B, you can't say the same about bitcoin, transactions = big energy output.  

""but defi is the future, we don't need banks"". You may be right, but if you look at sites like nexo/celsius, they are still companies with employees, they are competing with banks providing lendings, customer supoort, cards and insurance, not bitcoin. And they are doing fine.

""the media attacks crypto even though most a lot of coins aren't using PoW or will move to something else in the near future"". Hmmm, so you are saying there are better solutions out there and still its better to not talk about bitcoin's energy waste? Sorry, but this is just delusional. 

Crypto is at its core pushing technology forward and breaking paradigms, and with more adoption it also comes spotlight. If you look into the crypto space in 5 years and see that most coins and decentralized platforms are using something different than pure PoW, and bitcoin is still using PoW and consuming 10x energy from what it does now, you should think that's there's the possibility governments could act against mining, this year you saw hash rate drop with government-instituted blackouts in China, it wouldn't take much for countries to criminalize PoW mining if bitcoin is the only coin doing that and pretending nothing is happening while shouting ""I'm the king"". 

TL;DR: bitcoin's PoW is a cow infinitely farting, there shouldn't be negationism in this space about it as everyone else is inserting corks inside their cows butholes.",postal_card,1620191218.0,11173,CryptoCurrency

[Cryptocurrencies risk undermining sanctions against Russia, allowing Putin and his cronies to evade economic pain.  ](https://preview.redd.it/acyupa6vrsk81.jpg?width=1184&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1402d66b989ee6048bec4f4ed100fe1a8bc28a17)

Except this is not whats happening, and on the contrary its Ukraine thats using crypto for good. Yet none of these Senators celebrate crypto for what its actually being used for, but instead create a non-story to serve their vested interests of slamming crypto.

How pathetic could all of this get? 

She just wants an opportunity to somehow link it to hit out against crypto. Using her public and visible position to spread her own agenda when the country thats most affected by whats going on is actually  using crypto for the betterment of its people in the present terrible situation.

And was able to find a bit of humor even in circumstances such as now..

Edit: There are of course a possibility that this could happen, but as of now there is no evidence that it is happening. Nor is it likely in the future, infact Russia is more likely to use China's SWIFT replacement known as CIPS - Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, or use their own SWIFT replacement SPFS (less likely as low liquidity).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPFS - Russian Central Bank has already said SPFS could be an option, and 23 countries foreign banks are already connected to it. 

USA is already the largest liquid crypto markets, if Russia starts accepting crypto for their strategically important export oil, they wont have any places to spend their crypto as the liquid USD-crypto market is already closed for them. Whats the point of earning say 10,000 crypto coins for a million barrels of oil, if they cant spend it anywhere due to lack of counterparties willing to trade with them? Russian Ruble - crypto pairs are non-existent today. Also, they cant use that crypto to buy commodities from other countries either, as these countries could come under risk of sanction themselves, and furthermore high volume crypto-commodity market is also non-existent right now. No country is going to be ready to start accepting say 10m  tonnes of Wheat for Crypto. Such a scenario is not even possible right now given the structure of crypto markets.

That is why it is important for USA to actually build dominance in crypto markets, and yet you have people like Liz spinning up a""crypto is bad"" narrative whenever they get the chance to do    

Being afraid of Russia using crypto to evade sanctions is literally being scared of the boogeyman, especially when CIPS and SPFS offer much more immediate options for them.",Set1Less,1646152009.0,7697,CryptoCurrency

This right now is peak crypto-fear. If you are still sticking to Crypto you are truly a holder and you can go through the worst bear markets.,"Bitcoin just made its wickets below 28 and even further down to 25k. Luna is basically going down in a literally straight line and achieved 1$ before even UST. We got over a billion long liquidations. Today the markets just shed $200B alone from the combined market cap. This is not everyday Crypto, this is historical.

With that it's highly impressive if you are still sticking around here and possibly even filling your bags with this discount. You are literally surviving one of the biggest bear markets in Crypto history while reading this, you are actually one of the last ones still actively being here. That's called a holder and not someone who holds during 1000% gains.

"2.5 Year Update: I took out $125,000 in Personal Loans & Balance Transfers to Buy Crypto","**tl;dr:**¬† Over the course of the past 2.5 years, I took out \~$125,000 in personal loans and credit card balance transfer loans to purchase 4.5 Bitcoin. I've paid \~$8,000 in interest so far and currently owe \~$45,000 on my loans.¬†

The average price I paid is \~$29,550 per Bitcoin which brings my cost basis to \~$133,000. The current value of the Bitcoin as of today, August 16th, is \~$265,000 which comes to a 99% profit or \~$132,500 in dollar terms.¬†

I have no plans to sell any of it. Just buy and hold. I service the debt with earned income from my job. I can easily afford the payments. I should have it all paid off by summer of 2025‚Ä¶ so long as I don‚Äôt take out even more loans to buy more Bitcoin!

Also, important to mention, I paid off all of the personal loans! So no more interest charges. The remaining \~$45,000 I owe is from the balance transfer which have 0% interst for at least the next 18 months. I'm sure I'll have them all paid off before then.

I‚Äôve made updates every 6 months. Feel free to view my post history to learn more about my strategy.

Two of the most Frequently Asked Questions I get.

1. **Why take out loans when I could just buy Bitcoin from earned income?**

I do that as well, but if I only did that, then I would not have been able to buy nearly as much Bitcoin as I did at the lowest prices. Back in 2022, I knew we were in a bear market. I also knew that it wouldn‚Äôt last more than a year or two.¬†

So think of it like a reverse DCA. I pay the loans each month instead of DCA. This allowed me to buy a lot more Bitcoin than I otherwise would have been able to buy. I can easily afford the monthly payments to service the debt.

**2. This is too risky. You‚Äôre insane. You‚Äôre gambling. Never take out loans to buy Bitcoin!**

Not at all‚Ä¶ I have a thesis an a strategy!¬†

My thesis is simple: due to reckless fiscal and monetary policy (money printing) by our government, the US dollar will continue to depreciate in value, i.e. inflation.¬†

My strategy: take out loans in USD and buy  inelastic assets like BTC which will appreciate in value against the USD.¬†

The strategy is basically a speculative attack on the US dollar. Wall Street traders do the same thing all the time. Have you hear of the Yen Carry Trade? I‚Äôm doing the same thing except with USD and BTC.

Taking out loans to buy assets is fine, so long as you can afford to service them. Just don‚Äôt take out loans to buy liabilities!!!

"Indian government announces it will bring crypto under legal framework, taxable at 30% of gains. No capital losses or business expenses allowed","Indian government just announced that crypto will be taxed at 30% of gains. This is the first time the Indian government is discussing crypto taxation. 
The tax will apply to all gains on digital virtual assets, and no capital losses will be allowed. Business expenses will also not  be allowed.

Gifts in the form of digital currency will be also taxed in the hands of the receiver.

This is a landmark announcement as the first time the Indian government is announcing any law or regulation around crypto. So far nothing concrete was announced except rumors in the media. 

Now crypto being a taxable asset will lead to growth of adoption of crypto in India

> I propose to provide that any income from transfer of any virtual digital asset shall be taxed at the rate of 30%. No deduction in respect of any expenditure or allowance shall be allowed while computing such income, except cost of acquisition: FM Nirmala Sitharaman


Edit : Some sources are saying capital gains losses is not allowed only for offsetting it with other income sources. But it is still allowed within crypto. Waiting for more clarity on this.

Edit 2: ~~It seems completely no capital losses.~~ https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/memo.pdf

Law mentions ""aggregate income from crypto transfers"" - some seem to think this means crypto losses can be offset among crypto itself. 

> However, no deduction in respect of any expenditure (other than cost of acquisition) or allowance or set off of any loss shall be allowed to the assessee under any provision of the Act while computing income from transfer of such asset

> Further, no set off of any loss arising from transfer of virtual digital asset shall be allowed against any income computed under any other provision of the Act and such loss shall not be allowed to be carried forward to subsequent assessment years.


Edit 3: Most reaction seem to suggest 30% is really harsh. Especially when long term capital gains from stocks is like 10%. 30% will apply for developers and builders too, which will mean they will move to friendly tax jurisdictions rather than remain in India. Seems like a dumb and self defeating policy tbh.

The law taxes not profits but even transfers. So even simple actions like staking or moving funds or using a smart contract would become taxable. This is insane. Projects that originated in India like Polygon are already moving out, experts say most crypto companies will follow suit as a crypto native company doesn't want to deal with 30% tax for every transaction they make

Taxation is at 30% of gains if you are investing. If you are earning 100% of your income through crypto (lots of Indian freelancers/developers are, the tax will be at 30% of total income, which is definitely harsh)

Edit 4: CEX like WazirX and CoinDCX will now automatically report trades to the tax authorities as TDS. This is similar to other TDS tax deducted at source policies.  So if you are using them the gov will now automatically find out about your trades. 

While the tax provisions are definitely bad for Indian users, it creates clarity so now some rich guy with a few millions to spare who was interested in crypto, but waiting on the sidelines wondering if it will be totally prohibited or not can start investing as they know its not prohibited but taxed heavily. Could lead to more Indians getting in (i.e. Le india pamp)


**TLDR: Govt is taxing all crypto transactions including simple transfers at a flat 30% tax. No capital losses or business expenses allowed. In the same day, govt reduced corporate taxes to lowest in Asia, and offered loan and debt waivers for corporates. Fuel prices are soaring. There is literally nothing in this budget if you are middle class common person. If you run a billion dollar company, well there are few sops in it. Someone earning their income through crypto will get shafted. Massively anti-poor/anti-middle class, pro-elites, pro those who fund this sham government headed by dictator Modi. Honestly, fuck this..

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the FOUR YEAR REPORT for the 2018 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, NEM, DASH, IOTA,** and **Stellar.**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting every single month for four years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and more recently, the [2022 Top Ten a few weeks ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/). ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.
* **December** **Highlights:** A bloody, all-red month
* **Overall since Jan. 2018:** **ETH** solidly in the lead, followed by **BTC** and **ADA.**  After briefly pulling ahead earlier in the year, ***the 2018 Top Ten are now significantly underperforming the S&P 500*** over the same time period.  Q: So, big crypto fail, right?
* A: Only if I stopped after the first year.  The **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 406%, much, much better than traditional markets over the same time period (**fancy new chart at the very bottom of the post).

***Some exciting new changes for*** [2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!***

1. I'll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis (down to two reports per month)
2. Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time. 
3. Factoring in stablecoin gains:  In past years, I have not included the ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports.  This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).
4. Giveaways: Who doesn‚Äôt love a good old fashioned giveaway? I‚Äôll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I‚Äôm still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.
5. Friendly competition: I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP r/TotalCryptoMarketCap) to see which one outperforms.

https://preview.redd.it/lisz7rgxpgb81.jpg?width=411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbf41f94e9716f0140f3a7dfff3f655fa9d21a59

With 11,¬†**Bitcoin**¬†has two more monthly wins than second place¬†**Cardano**.¬†¬†**NEM**¬†has finished last place most often (12 months out of 48).

**Bitcoin**¬†is still the only cryptocurrency that hasn‚Äôt yet lost a month since January 2018 (although it has come very close a couple of times).

## Overall Update ‚Äì¬† 2021 ends with a whimper. After four years, ETH in first place, and Dash and NEM tied for worst overall performance.

After reaching an All Time High (+72%) in¬†[October](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46), the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio continued to lose value.¬† After four years of holding these cryptos, only 3 out of the 10 cryptos are in the green:¬†**BTC,** **ETH,**¬†and¬†**ADA.**

Overall, first place¬†**ETH**¬†(+413%) is well ahead of¬†**BTC**¬†(+257%) and third place¬†**ADA**¬†(+99%).

The initial $100 invested in first place¬†**ETH**¬†four years ago?¬† It‚Äôs worth $515 today.

**DASH**¬†and¬†**NEM**¬†are virtually tied at the bottom, both down over -86% since¬†[January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)**.**¬†¬†The initial $100 invested in each four ago is worth about $13 today.¬†¬†

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

https://preview.redd.it/mldnsr7zpgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=d82435bc0e39657707f2143fb5dd1951f6ddcfd1

End of December 2021 market cap:¬†**$2,211,626,655,207**

The total crypto market dropped significantly in December.¬† Crypto as a sector is still up +285% since¬†[January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).¬†¬†

There was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year‚Äôs Day 2018, you‚Äôd be doing much, much better than the Experiment‚Äôs Top Ten approach (+34%), the return of the S&P (+78%) over the same period of time, and nine of the individual cryptos within the 2018 Top Ten (except for¬†**Ethereum)**.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:¬†**$114B in**¬†[**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:¬†**$2.65T in**¬†[**October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46/)**.**

## Bitcoin dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/qygnx0a0qgb81.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=567958cf7214839fa7befa749d61125dade6a9a8

**BitDom**¬†declined a bit in December, ending the month at 40.2%.¬† When looking at the entire four year 2018 Experiment time frame,¬†**BTC**¬†dominance is near the low end.¬† For context:¬†¬†¬†

Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:¬†[**33% in January 2018**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one).

High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment:¬†[**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018:¬†

https://preview.redd.it/cxtd9lb1qgb81.jpg?width=339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25b3da0034194812e2b66f977450fff1555b48fb

The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost $325 in December.

If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today,¬†**the $1000 initial investment would be worth $1,341**, up 34% from¬†[January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).¬†¬†

Green is unfamiliar territory for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio and a recent development.¬† Over the first four years of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, thirty-eight months have been in the red, with only ten months of green.¬† And all ten of the green months have come in 2021.¬†

Here‚Äôs a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment four years ago:

https://preview.redd.it/cbumx113qgb81.jpg?width=654&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bba9861143359ff6b70ff0ca8e6ba75de5d00d6

The all time high for this portfolio is¬†[October 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46)¬†(+72%).¬† The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down¬†[\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).¬†¬†¬†

Remember: no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year.¬† The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Alright, that‚Äôs that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.

But I didn‚Äôt stop the Experiment in 2018:¬† I invested another $1000 in the¬†***2019***,¬†***2020,***¬†and ***2021***¬†Top Ten Cryptos as well (***(and, just announced,***¬†[***again in 2022***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!)***.¬† How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing? ¬†¬† 

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48): up +34% (total value $1,341)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36)¬†up +504% (total value $6,044)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24): up +795% (total value $8,951)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +292% (total value $3,921)

So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here‚Äôs the bottom bottom bottom¬†*bottom*¬†line:¬†

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,**¬†the combined portfolios are worth¬†**$20,257**¬†($1,341 + $6,044 + $8,951 + $3,921).

**That‚Äôs up +406%**¬†on the combined portfolios,¬†**down from**¬†[**last month‚Äôs all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-47)¬†for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiments.¬† Here‚Äôs the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/xcl80o35qgb81.jpg?width=511&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2cd4923360a5492259faf606b3649c893fd4b16

***That‚Äôs a +406% gain by investing $1k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four years in a row.***

## Comparison to S&P 500:

I‚Äôm also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.¬†¬†

https://preview.redd.it/3uss07c8qgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e68ae4c88a82ff35b70538ec11dd137e83447e2

After four years: the S&P 500 is up +78% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on¬†[January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)¬†would be worth $1,780 had it been redirected to the S&P.¬† That‚Äôs more than double the +34% return of the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio over the same period of time.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I‚Äôve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,780 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,900 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,480 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,270 today

Taken together, here‚Äôs the bottom bottom bottom¬†*bottom*¬†line for a similar approach with the S&P:¬†

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $6,430**¬†($1,780 + $1,900 + $1,480 + $1,270)

That is up¬†**+61%**¬†[since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)¬†compared to a¬†**+406%**¬†gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

Here‚Äôs a fancy new chart showing the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:¬†

True Unpopular Opinion: I don't want people to earn crypto from Reddit karma,"In case you haven't heard, Reddit is planning to expand the vault system to provide crypto for upvotes similar to how moons work in this sub.


I am very opposed to this, as moons have irrevocably damaged this sub by reducing it to constant reposts and diminishing contrarian opinions due to people wanting to earn free money.


I do not want the rest of reddit to fall victim to the same thing (at least to an even greater extent as people still do reposts just for meaningless karma).


But I realize that if crypto was integrated into Reddit that it would be a very bullish for the space.

This Flash Crash is Why Crypto Won‚Äôt Be Mainstream For Awhile,"I mean how bad do you feel for all the El Salvadorans that bought yesterday. We just got a 25% dip in most coins in less than an hour. 

This is one reason why we aren‚Äôt even close to being mainstream. This will scare so many investors and consumers away. To see their portfolio drop by 25% in less than 12 hours. They woke up with a quarter of their portfolio gone. 

Yes I do think this is just taking profits and a panic sale. Great time to stock up on crypto at a major discount. But still this is the crazy stuff that will keep crypto from being mainstream for awhile. 

Also another reason why taking profits is a good idea! If you don‚Äôt have fiat available. Maybe take profits next time so you‚Äôll have spending money on the next dip. 

Anyone else get any good deals or catch the drop? Good luck everyone!

EDIT: This is a good time to talk about a strategy I have. If you take profits you take them and convert to USDC. Then send them to Celsius, blockfi or crypto and let them earn interest. If a crash like this happens, you transfer them out and buy the dip.",JazzyJayKarr,1631027596.0,6367,CryptoCurrency
You can‚Äôt cry for decentralization and then cry that Russia is leaning on crypto to bypass sanctions.,"It just doesn‚Äôt work like that. It‚Äôs either decentralized or it‚Äôs not. You don‚Äôt get to pick and choose when or why it‚Äôs decentralized just because you don‚Äôt agree with the use case. 

Obviously, it sucks that psychopaths take to crypto to hide illicit activity, and that it gets publicized in a way that paints crypto in a bad light. But if we want crypto to maintain its autonomous decentralization, we have to accept all of its shortcomings. 

Crypto scares the shit out of the powers that be for all the reasons we love it. It gives power back to the people, unfortunately there's bad people out there and fear sells, so the media likes to focus on it.

I don‚Äôt agree with anything that‚Äôs going on in Russia right now, but I do believe in crypto maintaining its decentralization.",ipetgoat1984,1645882297.0,8755,CryptoCurrency
Nothing sucks more than not having money to invest in a crypto that you knew would pump.. and watching it pump.,"I knew for a while that a certain crypto would pump and have tried finding money to invest but I am currently paying off money from an unforseen event. 
So today I watch the charts and it's pumping... 

No money to put in and tears to my eyes.. 

Some people are very fortunate and have thousands to throw in and we all know that most of those people will make it big in this game.. sucks knowing you may never be that person.. 

I guess it's hard not feeling jealous. So I guess I'm writing this to preach solidarity with people like me who feel like shit watching coins you wanted to invest in pump before your eyes and there's nothing you can do about it.

**EDIT 5:** Huge shoutout to the /r/cryptocurrency mods. You guys are amazing.

Me and a few friends tried to warn them but with all the Wallstreetbets and GME hype, it allowed a ton of crypto newcomers who didn't know what a ""pump and dump"" scheme is to get scammed.

This comes right after the large doge dump.

The worst part is, their moderators made no efforts to remove posts related to the scam. It is reported that /u/nvok (a moderator of /r/Ripple and /r/XRP) and fellow moderators were allowing the scam to be promoted and were removing posts that were negative towards it. They also ban any users that critique Ripple or XRP (the token of Ripple). It is unknown if they were involved in the scam, but it is evident they failed to educate their users.

Feel free to **report both of those subreddits** by contacting reddit admins. You can find any post in /r/Ripple or /r/XRP and report it via the reddit contact us page as there is no other direct way to report a subreddit.

I spent at least $5 at Burger King every day from 11/1/2021 to 11/21/2021 to win free crypto.,"In an attempt to win Free Crypto by participating in [This Promotion](https://www.bk.com/crypto), I ate burger king for 21 days straight so you didn't have to.

You can't win if you don't play, Reddit. Here's how it went:

Day 1 - 8pc Ghost Pepper Nugs, Cheeseburger, Hershey's Sundae Pie - Total = $5.45 - **1 DOGE**

Day 3 - 8pc Ghost Pepper Nugs, Rodeo Burger, Hershey's Pie, ordered delivery today - Total = $13.74 - **1 DOGE**

Day 4 - This was a weird one. I actually tried to order delivery through the app, and the order failed because my nearest store was currently closed/not accepting orders. Still got the reward email and claimed it. Total = $0 - **1 DOGE**

Day 5 - Rodeo Burger, 3x Applesauce, lol really was not feeling BK today. - Total = $5.88 - **1 DOGE**

Day 6 - Ch'King Deluxe Sandwich - Total = $5.90 - **1 DOGE**

I won't be eating Burger King, or likely any fast food for a *long* time.

We've gotta talk about Republicans and crypto,"Tl;dr: Don't vote based on your bags. Republicans aren't the crypto boosters everyone makes them out to be, and the way Trump has used crypto as a grift to make money just reinforces existing stereotypes about crypto being scammy.

I know, I know. We're all saturated with politics and election crap right now and we're tired of it. Me too. But I hear the idea that ""Republicans are the pro-crypto party"" all the time and it's just not true.

https://preview.redd.it/e9aor4poqyyd1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9d39dea07e453748665ef5d8328094120fbb031

First, Republicans aren't uniformly supportive of crypto and Democrats aren't uniformly against it. My no-talent ass clown of a Senator (Roger Marshall) is a hardcore MAGA Republican but wildly anti-crypto. He called crypto a [""threat to our national security""](https://www.marshall.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-marshall-cryptocurrency-is-a-threat-to-our-national-security/) and co-sponsored a bill with Elizabeth Warren to make stricter AML/KYC regulations. During the FTX debacle he even suggested that the SEC [shut down all crypto transactions in the US](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/02/2022/roger-marshall-kansas). Saying that Democrats aren't supportive of crypto isn't true either. When you look at the list of [congressional candidates endorsed by Stand With Crypto](https://www.standwithcrypto.org/races/endorsed), half of them (19/39) are Democrats. Not to mention that Democrats incorporated some crypto-supportive events into the [DNC convention](https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/09/24/how-democrats-have-shifted-on-crypto/) and [Anthony Scaramucci has reportedly been working with Kamala Harris](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/20/anthony-scaramucci-kamala-harris-campaigns-digital-asset-policies-.html) to develop pro-crypto policies. Saying Republicans are the more crypto-supportive party may have been true 5 years ago, but that has changed.

Secondly, we've got to talk about Trump. Saying that Trump is pro-crypto is like saying a bank robber is pro-unmarked bills. [His recent ""pro-crypto"" turn](https://www.axios.com/2024/05/30/trump-crypto-bitcoin-nfts) is at best a flip-flop and at worst a grift. In 2019 he said that [Bitcoin was ""based on thin air""](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192?lang=en) and as recently as [December of 2021](https://decrypt.co/89108/donald-trump-calls-crypto-dangerous-even-as-melania-launches-nft), he called crypto ""dangerous"" and a ""scam."" ([And he would know!](https://apnews.com/article/17e975d3ccba4a92a9b023dff8437b21)) But recently crypto has been very kind to him. [One of his wallets](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/donald-trump) has almost $6 million in it.

Not to be too much of a conspiracy theorist, but It ***really seems like*** after Melania Trump made an [unspecified (large) amount of money on a bunch of NFT projects in 2021 and 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2022/jan/04/melanias-latest-nft-is-selling-for-180000-at-last-one-of-the-trumps-is-showing-entrepreneurial-spirit), Donald [suddenly changed his tune on crypto and started issuing a bunch of NFTs](https://decrypt.co/249755/trump-credits-nfts-change-of-heart-bitcoin-crypto) himself. When the NFT market dried up, he pivoted and was [collecting 2% of every transaction on shitcoins called things like ""Trump Bucks"" and ""Save America""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-donald-trump-made-nft-213019678.html) netting him at least a half million dollars. And of course don't forget about his newest ~~scam~~ DeFi project World Liberty Financial, [where 75% of all protocol revenue goes to the Trump family](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1g69fob/trump_family_gets_75_of_crypto_coin_revenue_has/) (who also has no liability) and who [couldn't keep their own website running](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/15/trump-familys-world-liberty-finance-token-sale-appears-to-go-live-selling-220m-wlfi-in-minutes/) during the rollout even though there wasn't much interest in the project.

I'm sure it's clear how I feel about him, and if you want to vote for him, be my guest. But don't do it because you think he's ""pro-crypto"" and will pump your bags if he's elected.

It seems pretty clear that he has no idea what crypto is or how it works. He [can't work a crypto wallet well enough to buy a burger with it](https://youtube.com/shorts/HIv4cwkz16U?si=2zjUCdPTnYVN9l_q), tweeted that he'll make sure Bitcoin is ""[made in the USA](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1852033244729860397)"" and stumbled through a [recent interview](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/donald-trump-struggles-and-seems-confused-in-painful-crypto-interview-while-trying-to-change-topic/ar-AA1qGv5X), saying:

At the very best, he doesn't give a shit and will forget about and ignore it once it stops making him money, which effectively gives other countries the ability to set crypto regulation and reinforces the stereotype that crypto is super scammy.

Average internet user is still strongly against crypto. If you think otherwise you are delusional and only visit crypto's part of the internet.,"If you think most people like crypto or at least are neutral and know something about it you have no idea what you talk about. Minority of people know anything about it.

Check you tube, tik tok, instagram or other social media. But not crypto channels or sites, those are pro crypto bubble, obviously most people there will like it. Check non crypto related ones that randomly mention crypto and you will regret it forever. Knowlege of average person in the internet about crypto is terrifying. Never saw so big amount of ignorance as superstition. Most people think it is fake internet money or biggest scam in history. And those people are not only boomers but millenials or gen z too. 

Main argument is that it is a scam, but ofc no one can logically answer why, they act  like medieval peasants toward ""witch"". No knowledge, just the same emotional repeated lies that crypto is dangerous, people lose money and my ""favourite"" that everyone should grow up and  work in 9-5 instead of wasting money and thinking about getting rich... Obviously anyone who invest and want to be successful is wasting time for those people. It is known internet hate any advices of making money, business or self improvement, but even most people that are seeking for bussines ideas, financial freedom and investing advices hate crypto.


Is visiting those places necessary? I think yes. Too many people in crypto space don't understand real situation and are too optimistic. Some truth will be refreshing  like bucket of ice on their head. Instead of only spending time  in crypto subs or channels you will see reality. Here everything is about crypto, outside not. And even if is usually not friendly at all. I tell it not to complain, get angry or be sad. But to simply understand ""the enemy"" and stop being ignorant. Nothing better in politics, music or business than meating people that dislike you. To much compliments lead to delusions.

This is now the second-longest bear market ever for crypto and likely to be the longest. Surviving this is no joke.,"With another black-swan in crypto and another leg down, this time due to FTX. We are now officially in the second-longest bear market ever, an achievement I do not know whether we should be proud of. Especially as with the current sentiment globally, this could very well be the most brutal and longest bear market.

Firstly, what is a bear market and how to define it? A bear market is basically a long period where the price remains significantly below the recent ATH. There is no fixed negative percentage to define one (stock markets use 20%) and its measured from ATH to the bear market low.

As we can now see that we are indeed longer in a bear market than during the 2018 ‚Äúcrypto winter‚Äú, even if we have hit our bottom right now (which is highly unlikely).

To become the greatest crypto bear market we are not too dar off either, the 2013-2015 bear market took 415 days, which would put us in early January which is very likely to still be in a bear market.

So be happy as you can soon call yourself a survivor of the most brutal and most long crypto bear market in history and that is not easy.

Do you think cryptos have become one more instrument for the rich to take our money?,"With the recent rugs pulls, and the generally unbridled speculation surrounding cryptos in the last year or so, I started having doubts about this whole thing.

At the beginning it seemed that Cryptocurrencies could be a place where even us poors could compete with the rich and make a lot of money. Now it looks like it has become another instrument for them to transfer money from the middle class to the upper class. This recent events aren't the natural ebb and flow of the market, but a deliberate attack to bankrupt small investors and newbies.

Do you think the crypto space will be different in a few years? Will it be an upper class only space? Where do the small fish go in this pond? Are we all gonna get eaten alive by sharks?

"For the crying out loud, stop telling your friends and family to invest in crypto","The first and only rule of persuading people to invest in cryptocurrencies is **don‚Äôt**.

We all want this community and the market to grow. I also understand that you want your friends and family to catch this *golden opportunity*. But persuading them to put their money in something they‚Äôre uncommitted to, **leads to FUD and paper hands**.

Understand that telling them, ‚ÄúI earned X amount in X days‚Äù translates to ‚Äú\[you could‚Äôve\] earned X amount in X days \[but didn‚Äôt\].‚Äù In their minds. **You‚Äôre leveraging their fear of missing out**.

"The mass adoption won't happen until ""Apple"" of crypto comes along.","It's pretty simple really. To get mass adoption to the levels we want, we need an iPhone style event into the market, by some massive and already well-established company. Sure LG and other companies made touch screen phones before Apple did, but Apple did it better and they made it much more simple to use. They've dumbed down the whole thing, so even half-trained monkey could do it.

This is what we need in crypto. Right now all we have is a crap-ton of different chains, bridges, multiple ecosystems, multiple wallets etc. it's just too much for the average Joe. Heck, even for myself it was truly difficult to sell one coin the other day (not gonna shill here any names). It took me around 12 different steps, moving between bridges, converters and so on etc. before I was finally able to cash it out to FIAT without destroying myself with high fees to make it worthwhile. Sure, I could just cash out via traditional methods, but I'd lose like 15% of my coins doing that. This stuff should be automated a long time ago.

But this will take time, a lot of time. The true adoption will start when we are allowed to just add crypto to our Google Pay or Apple Pay by scanning a quick QR code from our crypto wallet, without thinking two secs or giving a single fuck if our coins are going to disappear because we've mistyped one or two letters in the wallet. Or because your wallet supports coins X, Y, Z but not coins A, B, C. Until then ""mass adoption"" is just an empty slogan that won't happen for another 10 years or more.

Welcome to the scary part of crypto. This is where gains are made.,"If you are new to crypto, these times can be scary. It's uneasy for all of us.

But it's at these times gains are made. Not by trading (for some, sure) but by studying and planning your strategy. Now it's time for you to do your research on which coins you believe in and align your bags accordingly. 

**It's true what they say, ""Time in the market, beats timing the market""**. So don't over-leverage, don't sell high or on the way down, and stick to projects/coins you believe in. If you believe in crypto, your goal is to still be in this game years down the road. 

And it's way more profitable than jumping ship from coin to coin depending on what's pumping. Plus you will learn a lot along the way.

Once you've aligned your bags accordingly, all you need to do is to lay in a coma, trust your intuition and try to keep yourself from refreshing prices 24/7. 

This part is difficult for all of us to do, but it's important. Doing this is a lot easier if you have hobbies or things you're passionate about outside crypto. So try to pick up a new hobby or do something that keeps you from looking at charts every 5 minutes and FOMO into any shitcoin that's pumping this day. 

Best of luck to all of you.",Frederik1234,1621168624.0,8189,CryptoCurrency

I'm been in crypto since 2013. Maybe 700+ alt coins and many trades. Now a Defi-Crypto Farmer. Here are some of my tips and advice for new-comers.,"As the title says I'm into crypto pretty deep.  I was in crypto briefly in 2013, but only really hit the ground running in 2017 and never looked back.  In 2017 I made all the usual mistakes, got into the wrong coins, entered some dodgy exchanges and sold the wrong coins (like selling Enjin on its first day after investing in the ICO).  In 2018 things got worse, with shitcoins driving the BTC value of my holdings down by half.

Now I'm sitting really pretty and feel like I have ""clicked"" to the point where I am generally making money in crypto and quite a few people ask me for advice on what to do, strategies etc.  Here are some of my tips, observations and ideas.

1. Don't trust anyone.  Assume everybody you are talking to is a friendly thief who wants your money.  That includes people shilling particular coins, or anyone asking for your crypto to invest, to random people that message you.  (And yes ironically this means don't trust me, but you'll see I didn't mention my altcoin holdings and I am deliberately staying quiet on what my 800% defi pool is  :) )
2. Every position you enter should be a fixed percentage of your portfolio.  I prefer 1% for a typical trade.  Risky uniswap gems might be 0.5%, very strong longer term positions say 2-5%.
3. Have your portfolio value in BTC (or ETH if you prefer that).  Your goal is to increase your BTC value.  Each trade should be from BTC, and then exit back out of BTC.  Log all transactions in blockfolio etc under the BTC pair, so you can see how much BTC value you are gaining.  Don't worry as much about USD gains, as in a bull market its easy to make USD value gains.  BTC is the end-game here so you want to accumulate BTC, especially if BTC dominance is falling.
4. Have a portion of your portfolio allocated to farming or staking.  If you have a coin sitting somewhere for ages, ask if there is some way for you to make money from it.  For example, I have a large stack of BTC and ETH, so rather than have it sitting doing nothing, I wrapped the BTC and entered a Sushi Farm.  Months later the rewards from that farm are worth something like 25% of the amount I initially invested.  Every so often, harvest the rewards and either re-farm (compounding) or shift to your long term hold.  Remember compound interest.  There are opportunities for very high returns (without ponzi aspects but be careful) - find those, constantly take and re-invest the income and the gains are quite extreme.
5. Have a dedicated stack of BTC or ETH that is your ""HODL"" portfolio that you never touch.  Preferably in seperate legal entity (like a trust) than what you trade with.  This will help for taxes.  Every so often, move some profits into that long term stack.   I don't do anything with that stack at all, it is just my safe holdings.
6. Spend as much time learning about tax as you do trading.  Tax is something you kind of need to understand upfront - you can get way more rekt from bad tax approaches than you make gains with good trading.  And keep your records safe - download all trade histories at the end of every quarter.
7. Use telegram (or discord).  Find really helpful smart and useful people and stick to them.  Find helpful trading groups.  Eventually they will be a vital source of information or just ways to bounce ideas off.  Check out my previous post for a full guide on ""must have"" telegram groups.
8. Read the crypto news as much as you can.  Its amazing how often something pops up (e.g. grayscale announcing new trusts with other coins) and there is still a decent amount of time to buy.  And always have some BTC on an exchange ready to buy on such an opportunity.  Again, telegram is great for this as you can quickly see tweets or news-links being shared.
9. Have a preset % of gain or losses whereby you will sell if it reaches that.  For example, for most coins, if a coin ever goes up more than 30% vs BTC in a day I always sell.  95% of the time that works out as better than holding.  In the rare event I double my position I always sell the principal immediately (I did this twice this year - with Ethernity and Blind Boxes).
10. Always have an idea as to what the current ""climate"" is in terms of what is moving and in favour.  Crypto markets often move with certain sectors at a time.  For example, if you look at the Coin Gecko categories list, you can immediately spot what is ""hot"" right now.  Last month it was NFTs, so I was heavy in that space, but now that sector is cooling.  The binance smart chain and exchange coins are doing very well right now - if that is the case what else might move?  Well other low gas blockchains could be an idea - especially if they have defi - so Avax, Raydium etc are all moving too.  Soon it might well be BTC's time to gain as the expense of alts.  You should be rotating in and out of positions to try and go with the ebb and flow of the market.
11. For newcomers, start with basic stuff like accumulating bitcoin, learning to use a wallet, security etc.  Don't just dive in and ape into defi coins, wsb style.  It may suck that it feels like you are missing all the gains from the ""hot"" new coins, but it will equally hurt if you are just burning through your capital.
12. Look out for free crypto opportunities.  They key here is sorting out the gems from the scams.  This isn't just staking etc but also things like reddit moons and airdrops.  A lot of people are even ""airdrop farming"" whereby you have wallets that carry out certain activities deliberately to try and qualify for future airdrops.  Coin market cap earn and coinbase earn are two more.  Even something like the binance ""dust"" feature to turn dust into bnb is a way of generating some more bnb (even if its tiny).  Check out my previous post on free crypto and ways to get passive income
13. For farming, make sure you are using the right apps like zapper or apy vision to track all your positions, your yield and any impermanent loss.  That will also help with tax records down the track, should you need it.  Watch out for farming on the ETH network as your gas fees will chew up any gains if you have small positions.  Check out my previous post of sushi farming for how the rewards and gains work
14. Track all your numbers, your gains, your investments and portfolio change religiously, preferably in an excel document.  That way you'll know how you are performing and if something is going wrong.  Again, I wish I had done this more in 2018.
15. Have an ""emergency reserve"".  For me, this is actually my stock positions, many which are crypto related, but you could have gold or cash (I especially like the idea of something like stable coins lent on FTX at a decent interest rate).  If we get some kind of crypto turbo dump which is 40%, you can then have that as money on the side-lines ready to buy.
16. Constantly educate yourself.  For me, I still need 3-4 hours a day to research and learn about crypto.  I find crypto podcasts and even youtube vital sources of information, provided you are listening to the right people.  Mix up your education with news, technical strategies, trading updates, altcoin news and even just the general philosophy behind sound money and financial sovereignty.
17. If you win or lose on a trade, delete that coin from blockfolio immediately.  Why?  Because you have exited that position, and seeing it jump up again in price is just going to torment you.  You've made the decision to sell, don't even up revenge trading where you come back and try and get your losses back on the same trade.
18. Never margin trade UNLESS it is only because you want to minimise your funds at risk on an exchange.  Even then I'd avoid it.  Unfortunately many exchanges make this very hard to use - and there are confusing terms and default options which can rekt you (for example, positions that will drain your other funds instead of liquidiating the trade if falls too much).  In fact, I avoid almost all USD pairings and only trade BTC pairing, unless very special circumstances are in play (such as ripple being delisted from coinbase).
19. Never hold more than around 10 coins.  I used to have up to 40 at a time, it became impossible tracking them in terms of activity, prices, and god the horrors of trying to maintain enough wallets for them.  10 is enough diversification.  I used to have a ""bag"" of around 15 moonshots - that strategy never worked as even if one ""Gem"" actually made it big, the losses from the other ones cancelled out.  Typically if I had a huge gain from one of my coins, I sell back to BTC and waits for other opportunities.  This isn't Pokemon - don't try and ""catch them all"".
20. Falling in love with alt-coins is like falling in love at a stripclub.  Yes trade them.  But just be conscious that their chances of beating BTC long term are very unlikely.  Just look at all my 2013 gems (peer coin, feather coin etc).  Heck I bought World-Coin because I read about a ""bitcoin genius teenager"" who made millions from crypto and said World-Coin was the next bitcoin.  And I've made my mistakes as well going forward, holding on for dear life for nano (yes I know its fast and instant!) and grin.  I think the tech for both coins is great, that doesn't mean its a great trade.  If you want to marry your alt-coins then you will be lucky if you only lose half your money like a real world divorce :)
21. EDIT. Bonus one.  Always learn from your losses (and I have MANY).  I like to think of crypto as like a computer game where you are gaining new skills.  Think of RPG games like Baldur's Gate or Warcraft.  You can earn money or experience, and use that to gain new items or skills that protect you against certain things.  So maybe you lost $500 to a ""rug-pull""?  Well do your research and figure out how to avoid that next time.  Maybe you'll spend the next 2 weeks mad about it, but next time a potential rug-pull project comes along you'll dodge it - congratulations you now have learned ""immunity to rug-pulls"".   Keep learning and gaining more experience and you'll start avoiding all the traps.
22. EDIT 2:  You are going to have MANY scenarios where you see a coin that has gone x1000 or to some ridiculous crescendo, where you feel utterly compelled to buy to avoid missing out.  This is the obvious trap (if you want an example of this look at Safemoon right now.  Bitconnect was the one in 2017 and there are others).  At some point bitcoin or ethereum will do a similar run up, and many people outside crypto will do the same thing.  Yes this can be irresistible but you must resist the temptation - think of the cryptos has being a bunch of boats on the wharf, and there are thousands of boats.  Every day another hundred turn up.  Why are you going to try and jump across the water to get to the boat that is already leaving, when if you wait a bit another few dozen will turn up in five minutes?  You'll just fall in the water and miss out on those new boats!
23. If you must trade as a new-comer, I highly suggest trading the smaller / middle cap BTC pairs.  Not the USD or margin pairs.  Certainly not something like futures contracts on FTX.  Why?  Because if you are on bitmex / bybit / ftx etc you are swimming with the whales and sharks, quant funds, robo-traders and the like.  If you entered the casino for the first time in your life, would you immediately go to the blackjack table with James Bond and Dr Evil?  The smaller BTC pairs are more likely to have less experienced traders - my trades actually went positive once I moved from USD pairs on margin exchanges to spot BTC trades with altcoins.
24. Last edit before bed (I promise).  The chances are, crypto is still cyclical.  That means we will have another bear market, or at least a very long boring period of no gains.  If you have just joined crypto, you probably won't ""make it"" this cycle, as we may only have 6 months to a year to go.  I actually lost money (a lot) in BOTH the 2013 and 2017 bull markets (-50% and -85%, respectively).   All of my gains were made in the bear market when I was buying BTC and alts when BTC was in the 3ks.  The ""will you make it?"" test isn't coming now when the market seems to be going infinitely up and everybody is winning.  That test comes when everybody is selling and it seems like you are the only buyer.  And yeah, thousands of alt coins will suffer or die at that point.   So be around to scoop up the ashes - don't be the ashes!  This is all a larger part of learning to move with the cycles.

Anyway these are the ones that come to mind, hopefully that is helpful!  No doubt I'll edit this post and add a few more.",Cryptodragonnz,1618108668.0,10422,CryptoCurrency

"No, leaving your crypto on an exchange is not the end of the world and you don't have to move your $100 woth of crypto to a cold wallet","Maybe it is just me but I totally trust exchanges to take care of my crypto. Of course I am speaking of popular and trustworthy exchanges. Leaving your crypto on an exchange nobody has ever heard of is of course a dumb idea.

But do you want to tell me that your crypto is not safe on Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Crypto.com or Voyager? It is 2021 and not 2014 and these exchanges can not be compared to Mt Gox.

Also sometimes people get the whole ""not your keys, not your crypto"" thing too seriously. I have seen people here complainig that they lost a big amount of their ETH to move it to a cold wallet. Well, high gas fees are another topic but you definitely shouldn't move your crypto to a wallet if you have to lose like 1/4 of it to do that. If you just have 0.05 ETH or similar then just leave it on the exchange. Nothing will happen to it.

Not to mention that if you are new in crypto then it is more likely for you to lose your piece of paper with your seed phrase than an exchange like Kraken or Coinbase to get hacked. If you ever accumulate a bigger amount of crypto then you could think about buying a cold wallet!

"Never forget what Robinhood did during the last bullrun, a warning to new people just learning about crypto.","First up, Robinhood is a regulated trading platform that also includes crypto, it is fully regulated under US laws by the SEC. Yes, that SEC. During the bullrun of 2021 when prices were starting to spike, they disabled people from being able to buy crypto or load money onto your account. The reason they gave was ' extraordinary market conditions. ' In reality the bullmarket wasn't at its peak yet which would only occur November of 2021. It was starting to heat up and naturally people wanted to get in a bit earlier so they can make a profit.

People were so angry that they left 100K+ negative reviews for Robinhood which Google went and removed for them. See what happens when a crypto service is under government control. They literally cheated retailers out of potential profits and are still operating today and many people still use them!

This is a warning, they also did it with GME which was a different stock, but we won't get off topic, you can google that if you want to know more. Just a heads up because the Btc halving is less than a year away, stay away from Robinhood. With them it's not a matter of if, but when.

This world is rough we all know it and I am genuinely into crypto for hookers and cocaine like the title says. Maybe dinner bills too. We only have one life to live we must enjoy it.

Also commenting about hookers and cocaine is hilarious and I often cry from laughing about it. We laugh at what's true.

 We must not forget to laugh in this crypto community. Thanks for those laughs.

May all of your bags lighten, may your pocketbooks get heavy and please don't forget to of course enjoy some hookers and cocaine on the side.

Happy new crypto year

"If you support crypto, please read.","I know many of us disagree on many things. We all have our favorite pet projects and argue about everything from proof of work versus proof of stake, to store of value versus medium of exchange. Some of us are into defi, for others its NFTs; maybe it's meme tokens that float your boat, or just plain old electronic cash.

But I like to believe we also all share something in common. We believe in the power of crypto. We believe in what it represents and what it can one day make possible. But it's not just going to happen on its own. The future isn't going to be handed to us on a silver platter and it's going to take as many of us as possible to fight the powers that be and make our voices heard.

I'm not proposing we take down the fed tomorrow, but what I am talking about is something much smaller, something I'm hoping you can help me set right.

The other day I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qyb6zt/an_open_letter_to_johnny_lyu_and_kucoin_exchange/) about the exchange Kucoin. I explained how they've been holding \~$50K of my BCHA (aka XEC on every other exchange) for over six months without letting me withdraw. I shared emails showing how they've given me nothing but the runaround since May, and how Kucoin themselves had [announced](https://www.kucoin.com/news/en-kucoin-will-support-bcha-upgrade-0820) their support of this project 3 months ago, causing me and others to buy even more.

[People's exchange my ass.](https://preview.redd.it/qwcsz21p09181.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=85286d659c2edec9267f65c9b0496e13e328e285)

But they've failed to live up to their word.

While I was thankful to see so many kind and supportive comments, giving me hope for the crypto community at large, I'm sorry to say Kucoin still has yet to tell me when I'll be able to withdraw my coins.

To those who suggested I just sell my BCHA and withdraw in USDT, the fact is I can't because there is no liquidity left. Who wants to buy a coin on an exchange if you can't withdraw, and I hold enough coins that I would have to sell for cents on the dollar if I did. Not to mention I'd just be passing off the problem to some other poor soul.

But what's most important is that I shouldn't have to do any of that. And giving up would just be letting Kucoin off the hook, which I'm not about to do.

So I'm asking for help from the wider cryptocurrency community. I want to believe that people in this community, more than any other, understand the difference between right and wrong and believe in a sense of justice in this world.

I'm asking you to help me right this wrong, and share this post with as many people as possible. My goal is to reach the top of this subreddit and send a loud message to u/Johnny_Kucoin (Johnny Lyu, CEO of Kucoin) that his exchange can't get away with this.

At this point I know that \~$50K of my money is probably gone, but I want everyone in crypto to hear about this so they understand the type of exchange Kucoin is. Because if they can steal my money, there's nothing stopping them from doing the same to you.

I for one am tired of industry players who give crypto a bad name. It's time to call out bad actors and send a message to these companies that they must treat their customers right or we'll simply move our business elsewhere.

I know this is a longshot, but I'm asking you to spread the word, because I am confident that this space is full of amazing people who believe in supporting each other and holding bad actors accountable.

I'm not a vindictive person. I don't want Kucoin to go out of business. I just want them to do the right thing and make sure others aren't cheated out of their money like I was.

Thank you for reading and best of luck to everyone.",BCHcain,1637640126.0,5443,CryptoCurrency

Why is everyone so sure that crypto will always bounce back strong at some point?,"This isn't fud or anything.  I actually have most of my money in crypto so I make posts like these somewhat in part for my own sanity too and the discussions on these topics.

I notice a lot of smart people who analyze the market seem to think there's always a strong likelihood of reaching new highs in the future. 

IE- the market may go down a lot and reach bear markets but somehow it will bounce back and eventually reach new all time highs at some point for bitcoin, etherium and others. 

I'm curious to ask here- how confident are you that crypto will continue to do this and why?

Save yourself trouble and just stay quiet about investing in crypto,"  

My only friend in the whole wide world just got into crypto because I told him that I made a small profit since I started. My pal went ahead and started watching bitboy-like youtubers and lost a whole lotta money. Now he is trying to blame it on me for telling him to get into crypto. 

I wholeheartedly believe that telling your friends or family about investing in crypto is just asking for trouble. Money can be evil and can destroy many things, also long-time friendships and even family. I‚Äôve seen it before with some of my relatives and you don‚Äôt want that.

And family dinners will be far less enjoyable when crypto will dip and they will start lecturing you with ‚ÄúI knew that computer money is a hoax‚Äù. They don‚Äôt understand crypto. They don‚Äôt even remotely understand what it‚Äôs trying to achieve.

FINALLY got all my crypto off Robinhood. You should too. ASAP.,"I'll admit it: I've kept a large sum of my crypto on Robinhood this whole time... until now. To be fair, I had stopped actively buying with them a year ago, but had decided not to sell since they had announced they were developing crypto wallets. So I decided to just hodl until I could transfer out... and that time has finally come! Last night I finally received word that my wallet was ready. **As of this morning the remaining assets I has hodling have been transferred OUT!**

Screenshot: [https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS](https://imgur.com/a/unzF2sS)

**I STRONGLY urge you to do the same if you have not done so already.** It's worth the gas price too ([which is a little lower than normal right now](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_gas_price)). If you've quietly been waiting for your Robinhood crypto wallet, it should come soon. I was around number 55k in line to receive mine.

*Why transfer out?* If you're not aware, Robinhood restricted trades during the the GameStop/meme-stock mania last year which effectively helped shady hedge funds and hurt regular folk like you and I ([see more about that here](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/robinhood-backlash-what-you-should-know-about-the-gamestop-stock-controversy/)). They were also fined $70M by FINRA over other shady practices, including having ""outages"" during big market swings between 2018 and 2020 ([check that out here](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/technology/robinhood-fined-misleading-customers.html)). This was especially a frustration last year when Robinhood suddenly suffered ""technical difficulties"" during the epic Doge runup ([more info here](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419159/robinhood-dogecoin-outage-crypto-trading-crash#:~:text=Robinhood%20confirmed%20that%20it%20experienced,the%20beginning%20of%20the%20day)). So then, it's pretty clear that Robinhood's interests are NOT with you. **Why trust them with your assets when they block you from making financial decisions during critical market movements?**

I'm not the only one in this sub that is alarmed by Robinhood, please see these additional posts and comments from our fellow sub-mates for more information so you can make your own decision:

Realised where I‚Äôve been going wrong with crypto,"I first got into crypto years ago when Bitcoin was around 18k USD, it had already exploded as far as I was concerned, I was late to the party. I wanted to invest my ~$500 into something that could potentially make me rich if I chose the right coin. Even if Bitcoin eventually doubled in price which would be huge, I‚Äôd still only have $1000 which seemed boring. Instead I‚Äôd buy newer more volatile coins with low market caps hoping to 100/1000x my money in a short period.

Dump $500 into a coin that goes up a bit then down a lot more, cut my losses and think I‚Äôve found something better, rinse and repeat till my $500 is practically dwindled down to nothing anymore then invest new money and do the same again.

Wouldn‚Äôt like to guess how much I‚Äôve lost over the years but looking back, if I‚Äôd have just put everything into ‚Äúboring‚Äù Bitcoin not only wouldn‚Äôt I have lost money but I‚Äôd also have a nice amount of savings.

Here I am today looking at Bitcoin near 100k and a couple thousand ready to invest, even if Bitcoin goes to 200k which would be huge I‚Äôm still only gonna have <$5k.

"Crypto.com introduces Worldwide Account Protection Programme, protects victims of unauthorised transactions of up to USD$250,000","Just read the security report from Crypto.com in an official press release issued barely 3 days after the recent hacking.

I think this is impressive not just for CDC but for the crypto market in general, in building confidence in cryptocurrency. This is so vital considering how crypto is still held in suspicion by many.

To quote them:

>Crypto.com is introducing the Worldwide Account Protection Program (WAPP). WAPP offers additional protection and security for user funds held in the Crypto.com App and the Crypto.com Exchange.  
>  
>WAPP is designed to protect user funds in cases where a third party gains unauthorized access to their account and withdraws funds without the user‚Äôs permission. WAPP restores funds up to USD$250,000 for qualified users; terms & conditions apply.

Some noteworthy things you must do to qualify for the WAPP:

* Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all transaction types where MFA is currently available,¬†
* Set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transaction,
* Not be using jailbroken devices,¬†
* File a police report and provide a copy of it to Crypto.com; and¬†
* Complete a questionnaire to support a forensic investigation.

The WAPP will begin rolling out in select markets starting 1 February 2022.¬†

CDC has also :

1. migrated to a new 2FA infrastructure, with a longer term plan to migrate  to true Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
2. Introduced an additional layer of security on 18 Jan to add a mandatory 24-hour delay between registration of a new whitelisted withdrawal address, and first withdrawal.
3. Full audit of the entire infrastructure
4. Engaged with third-party security firms to perform additional security checks + threat intelligence
5. And of course, all affected customers have been fully reimbursed.

2nd Disclaimer: Being invested in crypto nor eating a vegan diet is bad, pushing the idea everywhere is.

But think about it. With families coming together over the holidays. Do you want to be the family member pushing his ideas to anyone there? Is it so hard to just be normal for a day or two?

"Forget Crypto, the entire stock market could crash in the upcoming months and you should prepare.","As much as I'd love all these signals to be FUD, the truth is, it's not. Even the Crypto market dipping for the two months is largely due to the stock market trending down along with energy prices all over the world. People can say what they want, but the FED has printed way too much money over the past 18 months. You cannot raise the supply of the USD by 50% and expect no consequences.

[Buffet Indicator: Anything Above 140&#37; is \\""Extreme Danger\\""](https://preview.redd.it/mkv4hafidxa81.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=b09588b880001358c44f70991913369704c3e1f5)

The way the stock market is booming right now is nothing less than abnormal. The S&P500 alone is **100%** higher than what it was in March 2020 while actual productivity has shrunk with people leaving jobs faster than ever. Moreover, the housing market booming makes zero sense. Houses continue to skyrocket in value faster than the already high inflation rate can keep up.

Companies are also being overvalued by hundreds of times if you compare their profits to the stock market. If you look at Tesla, it is often the most used example of an overvalued company, and even then it pales to some of the most overvalued companies in the market right now.

# The Illusion of Prosperity

Every hyperinflationary event is always followed by a fake illusion of prosperity. We've seen this happen with the Weimar Republic, Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Lebanon. For example, in the months following hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic, people were becoming wealthier in the millions despite coming out of a war just months earlier. The market was doing so good that it was called the ""Golden Twenties"" in Germany.

However, as the hyperinflation got closer, ""The citizenry saw prices going up due to shortages ‚Äî and as more currency was produced to pay ever-rising union wages ‚Äî buying activity became a frenzy."" This is very similar to the worker, logistics and countless other shortages we are facing today, this is not normal.

The interest rates of 0.25% by the Fed are also another indication of money supply being overstretched. The interest rates have been kept artificially low for way too long. Any country that has kept interest rates this low has always faced some kind of crash or economic crisis. The US can only do so for so long.

# Be Prepared

Recessions **are the inevitable result of the business cycle in a capitalist economy,** never believe people that say ""this time is different,"" and be prepared if things go south. Moreover, something even worse than all these indications is the debt level growing right before our eyes which is nearly $30 Trillion and growing exponentially. Moreover, the Nasdaq is already 8% down from it's ATH, while the S&P500 is 4% down. Maybe the crash comes in a few months or even years.

The best thing you can do right now to protect yourself is to keep an emergency fund that can act as a hedge in the case of hyperinflation or a sudden crash such as Gold or staked Crypto. Always be prepared for the worst because the current state of the economy is eerily similar to what has happened in the past right before a major economic crash.",Many_Scratch2269,1641832904.0,3491,CryptoCurrency

Good to see some people pushing for the right regulation of Crypto while keeping crypto adoption and government protection equally on sight.

Some may say that no crypto taxes at all would have been better but I disagree here, there should be no problem in giving some money to the government for public services (whether they actually do that is the other question) I mean we are protesting so that rich people should pay taxes so we should pay too.

The CryptoMoonShots subreddit has even started to outpace the Cryptocurrency subreddit in terms of growth. It is a terrible thing to see considering the vast majority of the cryptocurrencies advertised there there are complete scam projects. 

Don't get me wrong. Some low market coins do have great utility and great future potential, but when you start going lower into the low millions or hundreds of thousands, the risk far outweighs their benefits.

If you are new to Crypto, the best thing you can do in Crypto is DCA and accumulate larger projects for the long term. Crypto is not the stock market, and deviating away from trusted projects or trying to rely on technical analysis is very risky.

TLDR: Unfortunately a lot of the newbies that are joining Crypto are completely ignoring even top 100 coins and are choosing to put their money in these shady ""get rich quick"" schemes which is nothing short of gambling.",Many_Scratch2269,1642161737.0,3521,CryptoCurrency

"Real, mainstream crypto adoption is happening right now. You just haven't realized.","Yes, that's quite the title, I know. But after seeing the hundredth post on the frontpage talking about altcoins that have real use cases, I can't stop thinking about this one.

You all know Venezuela, right? The country with space-high inflation rates, the one that /r/cryptocurrency says crypto adoption is feasible. 

Well, it's finally really happening.

I'm Venezuelan, so let me explain some weird things about our economy. First, prices double every 3 months. Second, we don't have access to USD bank accounts in the country. And third, physical cash is scarce: Bolivares because you need a lot of them to pay for little, and USD because the ""dollarization"" isn't official, small change simply doesn't exist (coins, for example). This creates the perfect variables for digital, exact payment. This is where the Reserve Protocol comes in.

We have been using some digital payments app since a while ago, apps like Zelle, PayPal or Transferwise. The problem with those apps is that they often close accounts in Venezuela to avoid problems with the US government. Simply put, those companies just didn't want to deal with the problem that is Venezuela related legislation.

Enter [Reserve.](https://reserve.org/) The team at Reserve created a stablecoin alongside an easy to use app for mainstream use. The app allows people to deposit Bolivares (the local currency) from their bank account and instantly exchange them for dollars (RSV stablecoins!). You might be thinking, well, that isn't that big of a deal, is it? Thing is, it is. Venezuelans can't just exchange Bol√≠vares to USD legally because there aren't any bank accounts in USD inside Venezuela. The only way to save in USD would be to open an account in Panam√° or risk your money getting lost in Zelle or PayPal. The app allows people to send RSV, pay with RSV, receive any crypto and convert it to RSV or Bolivares and so on. Reserve is literally saving people from hyperinflation.

Well, why do I say mainstream crypto adoption is happening? Because people aren't paying in bolivares anymore. It is estimated that in 2020, 55% of transactions were made in foreign currency, and that number just keeps growing everyday. Now, the great part.

**The Reserve app has more than 100k downloads.** **People are using** **crypto, not as a way to invest, not as a store of value, but as it was intended: a currency.**  And it's happening right in front of us, but we're too worried about the price going up or down so much that we missed the real reason crypto is here: to serve as a currency when fiat fails us.

New Shocking US Crypto Regulation Far More Invasive [Due Diligence],"# New US Crypto Regulation Far More Invasive Than We Thought

**US Congress intends to regulate crypto on a level far deeper  than currently understood‚ÄïThey will:**

&#x200B;

* Designate Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks as commodities and regulate their transactions accordingly;
* Create legal uncertainty for all other crypto projects and ICOs by allowing them to be labeled as securities;
* Ban the use of (unauthorized) stablecoins;
* Introduce penalties for the use of mixers and privacy coins;
* Rebrand smart-contracts that take longer than 24 hours to deliver as futures contracts and regulate them accordingly;
* Re-define legal tender and change the way money is created by the Federal Reserve; and authorize the issuing of a digital USD of which all transactions are recorded;
* Introduce foreign regulations into US law for all virtual asset service providers in the US (and with US clients). This would not be done to then never use it.

&#x200B;

**In short: Congress wants to bring crypto-currencies under full oversight and control.**

These new regulations introduce massive regulatory burdens on existing projects, ban and criminalize current normal activities, restrain innovation and free enterprise, and even introduce a transparent central bank digital digital currency that redefines money as we know it!

According to United States representative Don Beyer, congress should incorporate ‚Äúdigital assets into existing financial regulatory structures.‚Äù(1) As you will see, they intend to do just that.

And it will change the way things are done for crypto forever‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

## <What This Post Is About_

This post provides an overview of the crypto legislation currently (September 2021) being put through US congress.

It does not just look at the proposed bills, but rather at the wide range of laws that are to be amended.

Once all the puzzle pieces are put together, the big picture reveals shockingly strict regulations of crypto and a complete overhaul of the idea of ‚Äúmoney.‚Äù This could have serious effects not only on the crypto sector, but also on the financial system as a whole.

Behind the excuses of preventing money laundering and ensuring investor protection, the use of crypto is transformed in something it was not supposed to be. Especially delicate is the fact that part of this legislation is drafted outside the US.

***Disclaimer***\*: This report provides a high-level overview of the US laws that are to be introduced/amended by two new bills. Its depth is limited by the inadequate knowledge of the author of the large body of US law involved, and given that these bills are subject to amendments and have not even passed into law yet, none of this information can be considered legal or financial advice.\*

&#x200B;

## <What Is Going On?

On April 06, 2021, a ‚Äúmust pass‚Äù bill was introduced called the ‚ÄúInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act‚Äù(2) (‚ÄúInfrastructure Bill‚Äù). It passed in the House of Representatives and, after fierce debate, the Senate. Hidden in this bill, an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code was added. It introduced new reporting requirements and obligations for record keeping.

While this bill created a lot of public outcry, more recently, a real game-changing bill was introduced in the House on July 28, 2021, namely the: ‚ÄúDigital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act‚Äù (3) (‚ÄúDigital Asset Bill‚Äù).

This bill proposes amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, Securities Exchanges Acts, and the Commodity Exchange Act. It changes the definition of legal tender, and it introduces international crypto regulation into US law.

This article looks at each of these amendments‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

## <Commodities or Securities?_

The main take-away is that two different bodies of law will apply to crypto projects: commodities and securities laws. So far, only Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks are confirmed to be commodities (see below). All other cryptos are subject to future guidance by market regulators:

*‚ÄúNot later than 150 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the SEC and CFTC shall jointly publish, for purposes of a 60-day public comment period, a proposed rulemaking that classifies each of the major digital assets.*

***Not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act***\*, the SEC and CFTC shall jointly publish a final rule that classifies\* ***each of the top 25 major digital assets*** *by (i) highest market capitalization and (ii) highest daily average trading volume as‚Äî*

*(1) a digital asset; or(2) a digital asset security.‚Äù* (4)

&#x200B;

## Interpretation:

* Cryptos will be subject to two different regulatory regimes: commodities and security regulations.
* Services engaged with both digital assets (commodities) and digital asset securities (securities) could be subjected to both regulatory regimes.

&#x200B;

## <Commodities Regulation_

The Commodity Exchange Act regulates the trading of commodity futures in the United States. Passed in 1936, it has been amended several times since then.(5) It provides federal regulation of all commodities and futures trading activities and requires all futures and commodity options to be traded on organized exchanges.

In 1974, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was created to oversee the market. With certain exceptions, the CFTC has been granted exclusive jurisdiction over commodity futures, options, and all other derivatives that fall within the definition of a swap. Certain cryptos will be regulated as commodities.

&#x200B;

## Definition of ‚ÄúCommodity‚Äù Amended to Include Digital Asset:

First and foremost, Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act on definitions will be amended to read as follows:

*‚Äú****The term ‚Äúcommodity‚Äù means*** *wheat, cotton, rice, corn, oats, barley, rye, flaxseed, grain sorghums, mill feeds, butter, eggs, Solanum tuberosum (Irish potatoes), wool, wool tops, fats and oils (including lard, tallow, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, and all other fats and oils), cottonseed meal, cottonseed, peanuts, soybeans, soybean meal, livestock, livestock products,* ***digital asset (including Bitcoin, Ether, and their hardforks)****, and frozen concentrated orange juice, and all other goods and articles, except onions (as provided by section 13‚Äì1 of this title) and motion picture box office receipts (or any index, measure, value, or data related to such receipts), and all services, rights, and interests (except motion picture box office receipts, or any index, measure, value or data related to such receipts) in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.‚Äù*(6)

&#x200B;

## Digital Asset Definition

Next, the end of Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act will be amended by adding a clarification of what a digital asset is (7)(definition to long to post here)

&#x200B;

## Smart Contracts with Delivery Time of More than 24 hours are Futures Contracts

A sharpening of the definition of retail commodity transactions could  decrease the options for the use of smart contracts outside of regulated  exchanges.

Currently, Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act prohibits persons that are not *‚Äúeligible contract participants‚Äù* or *‚Äúeligible commercial entities‚Äù*  to engage in agreements, contract or transactions in commodities on  leverage, margin, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a  person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar  basis.(8)

Next,  additional amendments mentioned in the SEC. 202 of the Digital Asset  Bill applies this on transactions done by smart contract of which the  delivery takes longer than 24 hours:

*‚Äú(ii) ‚ÄÇExceptions*

*(III)‚ÄÇa contract of sale that‚Äì*

*(cc)  with respect to* ***digital assets***\*, results in\* ***actual delivery*** *(including  transfer of control over private keys) n****ot later than 24 hours after the  transaction is entered into*** *and such delivery is accomplished by  either-*

*(AA) recording the transaction on the public distributed ledger for the digital asset; or*

*(BB)  with respect to digital which are not recorded on a public distributed  ledger for the digital asset, reporting the transaction to a CFTC  registered digital asset trade repository; or‚Äù* (9)

&#x200B;

## Dodd-Frank Act and Market Transparency

After  the 2008 financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act introduced strict  regulations for swaps. Naturally, these will also apply to digital  assets as well.

The definition of swaps, as provided by the  Commodity Exchange Act (section 1a(47)) is broad. For example, it could  refer to any ‚Äúagreement, contract or transaction‚Äù that ‚Äúprovides for any  purchase, sale, payment, or delivery that is dependent on the  occurrence, nonoccurrence, or the extent of the occurrence of an event  or contingency associated with a potential financial, economic, or  commercial consequence.‚Äù (10)

## Next, the Dodd-Frank bill authorizes the CFTC to:

* Regulate  swap dealers by installing capital and margin requirements, require  dealers to meet robust business conduct standards, and meet  recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
* Increase  transparency and improve pricing in the derivatives marketplace by  requiring standardized derivatives to be traded on regulated exchanges  or swap execution facilities and bring better pricing to the market  place and lower costs for businesses and consumers.
* Lower risk to the American public by moving standardized derivatives to central clearinghouses.(11)

&#x200B;

## Digital Asset Trade Repository

To  meet the above mentioned market transparency requirement, the Commodity  Exchange Act stipulates the need for a digital asset trade repository  to collect information on SWAPS in order to provide the public with the  correct market information:

*‚ÄúThe  term ‚Äòdigital asset trade repository‚Äô means any person that collects and  maintains information or records with respect to transactions or  positions in, or the terms and conditions of, contracts of sale of  digital assets in interstate commerce entered into by third parties  (both on chain public distributed ledger transactions as well as off  chain transactions) for the purpose of providing a centralized  recordkeeping facility for any digital asset, but does not include a  private or public distributed ledger or the operator of either such  ledger unless such private or public distributed ledger or operator  seeks to aggregate/include ‚Äòoff chain‚Äô transactions as well.‚Äù* (12)

&#x200B;

## Interpretation Commodities Regulations:

* As  of writing, only BTC and Ether (and their hard-forks) will be confirmed  as commodities. All other cryptos could potentially be regulated as securities (what this means is explained next).
* The fact that novel technologies such as Bitcoin and Ether are to be  subjected to a large body of law that developed around the trading of  livestock and frozen concentrated orange juice could spell regulatory  uncertainty for various business models in the industry.
* No  ‚Äútrading on margin‚Äù is allowed outside regulated entities, unless done  by high-level investors called ‚Äúeligible contract parties.‚Äù This could  perhaps frustrate particular ideas about decentralized finance or OTC  markets.
* Smart contracts  that take longer than 24 hours to deliver could be considered futures  contracts under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. That smart contracts can  be labeled as futures contracts appears indeed to be the opinion of the  CFTC.(13)

&#x200B;

## <Securities Regulations_

In  the US, securities are regulated by the 1933 Securities Act.  Additionally, the 1934 Securities Exchange Act further regulates the  trade of securities, and established the SEC to oversee these markets.

## Definition of ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù Amended to Include Digital Asset Security:

First  and foremost, Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act will be  amended to include a ‚Äúdigital asset security‚Äù (and exclude ‚Äúdigital  assets‚Äù) in the definition of security:

*‚Äú(10)* ***The term ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù means***  *any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap,  bond, debenture, certificate of interest or participation in any  profit-sharing agreement or in any oil, gas, or other mineral royalty or  lease, any collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or  subscription, transferable share, investment contract,* ***digital asset security***\*,  voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, any  put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate  of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest  therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle,  option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange  relating to foreign currency, or in general, any instrument commonly  known as a ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù; or any certificate of interest or participation  in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or  right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing;\* ***but shall not include any fiat currency, commodity, digital asset***\*,  or any note, draft, bill of exchange, or banker‚Äôs acceptance which has a  maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months,  exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which  is likewise limited.‚Äù\* (14)

## Digital Asset Security Definition

Next, the Digital Asset Bill (SEC. 101) defines what a digital asset security will be:

*‚Äú(A) IN GENERAL.‚ÄîThe term ‚Äòdigital asset security‚Äô means a digital asset that:*

*(i) Provides the holder of the digital asset with any of the following rights:*

*(I) Equity or debt interest in the issuer.*

*(II) Right to profits, interest, or dividend payments from the issuer.*

*(III)  Voting rights in the major corporate actions (which shall not include  new block creations, hardforks, or protocol changes related to the  digital asset) of the issuer.*

*(IV) Liquidation rights in the event of the issuer‚Äôs liquidation.*

*(ii)  In the case of an issuer with a service, goods, or platform that is not  wholly operational at the time of issuing such digital asset, with  respect to* ***any fundraising or capital formation activity (including initial coin offerings***\*)  which is accomplished through the issuance of such a digital asset,  issues such digital asset to a holder in return for money (including  other digital assets) to fund the development of the proposed service,  goods, or platform of the issuer.‚Äù\* (15)

&#x200B;

## What does it mean to be regulated as a security?

Investing in securities in the US is regulated to:

*‚Äúprotect  interstate commerce, the national credit, the Federal taxing power, to  protect and make more effective the national banking system and Federal  Reserve System, and to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets  in such transactions.‚Äù* (16)

Regulations  focus on both the issuing of securities (primary market), and  subsequent trade of such securities (secondary market).

The goal  of securities laws is firstly to require issuers to fully disclose all  material information that an investor would need in order to make up his  or her mind about the potential investment. A regulated company must  create a registration statement, which includes a prospectus, with  copious amounts of information about the security, the company, the  business, including audited financial statements.

Next, the  subsequent selling and trading in these securities is regulated, by restricting trade to market places over which the regulator has  oversight. The Security Exchange Act section ¬ß78l(a) states:

*‚ÄúIt  shall be unlawful for any member, broker, or dealer to effect any  transaction in any security (other than an exempted security) on a  national securities exchange unless a registration is effective as to  such security for such exchange in accordance with the provisions of  this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder.‚Äù* (17)

&#x200B;

## Summary of Securities Regulations:

* Crypto projects will need to be regulated and provide clear financial information for investors to make an informed decision.
* Trading of securities will generally take place on regulated exchanges.
* Any new fundraising or capital formation activity (including ICOs) are likely to be securities.
* When  a crypto is regulated as a security, the entire coin is subject to strict regulations. In the case of commodities, only specific use cases  (futures) are regulated. It is a big difference.
* US  Congress is taking a leap of faith. It needs identifiable persons to enforce a law upon. Who is going to be held accountable in a decentralized network? Many issuing companies have handed control over to network participants. Perhaps for this reason, Section 12(g) of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 will be amended to allow the issuer to apply for ‚Äúdesecuritization.‚Äù (18)  The question remains: who will apply for desecuritization once a  network is decentralized? The investors? Weren‚Äôt they the ones supposed  to be protected in the first place?

&#x200B;

## <Changing the Nature of Money_

These  regulations are not just about crypto. It is clearly part of a wider discussion on the future of money. As shown below, this bill not only  changes the definition of money in the US, but also changes how money is  created!

As a first, in Section 5312(a)(3)(B) of title 31, US  Code (Money and Finance) digital assets are included as a monetary  instrument.(19)  However, Section 5103, of title 31, US Code will be amended to  specifically exclude digital assets and digital asset securities as  legal tender.(20)  And finally, it is determined that digital assets and digital asset securities will not be covered by Federal Deposit Insurance (FDIC or  NCUA).(21)

&#x200B;

## Introducing the Digital USD (or Central Bank Digital Currency/CBDC)

After  slamming the door on digital assets to be used as lawful money, the  Federal Reserve Act is amended to provide the Federal Reserve Board with  far reaching new powers; section 11 will be amended to say:

*‚Äú(d) To supervise and regulate through the Secretary of the Treasury the issue and retirement of Federal Reserve notes (****both physical and digital****),  except for the cancellation and destruction, and accounting with  respect to such cancellation and destruction, of notes unfit for  circulation, and to prescribe rules and regulations (****including appropriate technology****) under which such notes may be delivered by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Federal Reserve agents applying therefor.‚Äù* (22)

In addition, Federal Reserve notes will in the future also be issued digitally; an amendment to section 16 confirms this:

*‚ÄúFederal  reserve notes, to be issued at the discretion of the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System for the purpose of making advances to  Federal reserve banks through the Federal reserve agents as hereinafter  set forth and for no other purpose, are authorized. Notwithstanding any  other provision of law, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System is* ***authorized to issue digital versions of Federal reserve notes in addition***  *to current physical Federal reserve notes. Further, the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System, after consultation with the  Secretary of the Treasury, is* ***authorized to use distributed ledger technology for the creation, distribution and*** ***recordation of all transactions***  *involving digital Federal reserve notes. The said notes shall be  obligations of the United States and shall be considered legal tender  and shall be receivable by all national and member banks and Federal  reserve banks and for all taxes, customs, and other public dues. They  shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department  of the United States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia,  or at any Federal Reserve bank.‚Äù* (23)

&#x200B;

## Interpretations on the Future of Money:

* The door is shut for the use of cryptos as legal tender.
* The  Federal Reserve Board is to be authorized to create and distribute a  ledger-based Federal reserve note that could be used for everyday  transactions in USD.
* Digital  federal reserve notes will make the ‚Äúrecordation‚Äù of all transactions  possible. Did they use this word because ‚Äúmonitoring all transactions‚Äù  would be too obvious? Recording all transactions without anyone looking  at them makes no sense.
* These  amendments significantly increase the power of the Federal Reserve.  Contrary to what is widely understood, the Fed does not ‚Äúprint money.‚Äù  It can only manage the money supply indirectly.(24)  The private sector ‚Äúcreates‚Äù most of what we use as money by issuing  credit. It is with the supply of credit by the private banks that the  monetary supply is inflated. Conversely, with the reduced demand for  credit, the money supply deflates. The Fed is not as powerful as it  wants the market to believe, and the Federal Reserve Act restricts a lot  of its actions. This amendment, however, could drastically expand the  authority of the Fed, by allowing them to create and distribute a  ‚Äúdigital USD‚Äù directly. It could change the entire structure of the  financial system and potentially have far reaching consequences.
* The  original idea behind the Federal Reserve was for private bank deposits  to be combined to provide an emergency line of credit in times of  economic stress.(25)  But if the Digital Dollar is based on a blockchain, how can it also be  based on reserves? And what mechanism will determine how funds (and how  much) are added to the economy? And where and how will they be  distributed? What about privacy and security? Will all this authority be  handed over to a board of seven unelected bureaucrats? This amendment  has the potential to change the way the Federal Reserve operates. This  deserves a wider discussion by economists and financial experts outside  the crypto-space as well.

&#x200B;

## <International FATF Crypto Regulation Introduced in the US_

Those  paying attention to international anti-money laundering legislation  know that the following sections from the Digital Asset Bill originate  from guidance issued by the FATF (Financial Action Task Force). FATF is  an intra-governmental organization [creating financial legislation](https://decentralizedlegalsystem.com/fatf-bitcoin-regulations-summary/).

In March, the Paris based FATF issued draft guidance(26)  (‚ÄúFATF Guidance‚Äù) on a number of topics. And even though this guidance  hasn‚Äôt been finalized, there are already a number of points directly  included in the Digital Asset Bill.

&#x200B;

## Banning the use of Stablecoins

Subchapter  I of chapter 51 of subtitle IV of title 31, United States Code,  department of treasury regulation, will be amended, to read as follows:

*‚Äú(a) IN GENERAL.‚ÄîBeginning on the date of the enactment of this section,* ***no person may issue, use, or permit to be used a digital asset fiat-based stablecoin*** *that is not approved by the Secretary of the Treasury under subsection (b).‚Äù*(27)

&#x200B;

## Criminalizing the use of privacy coins and anonymizing services (mixers, coinjoins)

The  bank secrecy act is going to be amended to sanction the use of  anonymity-enhanced convertible virtual currencies and anonymizing  services.(28)  It is worth noting that willful violations of the bank secrecy act  could give rise to a fine of not more than $250,000, or imprisoned for  not more than five years, or both.(29)

&#x200B;

## Introduction of the term Virtual Asset Service Provide (VASP) into US Law

Next, the term Virtual Asset will be introduced into Section  5312(a) of title 31, United States Code. A Virtual Asset can be a  digital asset, or *‚Äúa digital representation of value that can be  digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or  investment purposes;‚Äù*(30)

So  far we have seen a number of definitions. To understand their  relationship, the following image was made based on the definition of  Virtual Asset according to Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States  Code:(31)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/buzs5az1dro71.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b1726f091d09a7749d85d8e44af6ea8f5e45b7d

&#x200B;

Virtual  Asset is a broad definition; it covers most activities involving  cryptos. We can see in the Digital Asset Bill that entities that are  facilitating transactions in Virtual Assets are to be called ‚Äúvirtual  asset service providers,‚Äù or VASPS. Sec 301 of the Digital Asset Bill  defines a VASP:

*‚Äú(A) means a person who‚Äî*

*(i) exchanges between digital asset and fiat currencies*

*(ii) exchanges between digital assets;*

*(iii) transfers of digital assets;*

*(iv) is responsible for the custody, safekeeping of a digital asset or an instrument that enables control over a digital asset;*

*(v) issues or has the authority to redeem a digital asset; and*

*(vi) provides financial services related to the offer or sale of a digital asset by a person who issues such digital asset; and*

*(B) does not include any person who‚Äî*

*(i) obtains a digital asset to purchase goods or services for themself;*

*(ii) provides communication service or network access services used by a money transmitter; or*

*(iii)  develops, creates, or disseminates software designed to be used to  issue a digital asset or facilitate financial activities associated with  a digital asset.‚Äù* (32)

This  definition comes directly from the FATF Guidance, with the only  difference being that the US excludes the exchange between different  forms of one virtual assets. On the other hand, section (v) is a new  addition.

&#x200B;

## The Big Picture: Global Regulation

The logic  behind this seems to be to first introduce a high-level definition  (including coins regulated as commodities, securities, and everything in  between). Next, any future global restrictions on the wider  crypto-space can be applied at this level.

From the latest FATF  Guidance, a number of possible additional restrictions can already be  deducted. Things to look out for are the restriction of the use of  ‚Äúunhosted wallets,‚Äù the introduction of the ‚Äútravel rule,‚Äù labeling  those who engage in peer-to-peer transactions as a risk, and a whole  host of other measures. (33)

One  additional aspect of VASP regulation mentioned in the FATF Guidance is  also included in the Digital Asset Bill; VASPS engaged in services which  are available in the United States and to United States persons, have  to be regulated in the United States, even if the provider is located  outside the United States. (34)

## Interpretation International Regulation in the US:

* International AML legislation, created by Paris-based FATF, is being introduced in the US.
* The  FATF term ‚Äúvirtual asset service provider‚Äù (VASP) is introduced in the  US. The definition is so broad that it covers practically all crypto  projects.
* After first being  in the FATF Guidance, the banning of stablecoins and anonymity-enhanced  cryptos and the obligation for VASPs to be licensed in the country of  their clients are included in the Digital Asset Bill.
* It  is not hard to imagine that other restrictions for cryptos currently  discussed by FATF, such as the travel rule and restricting unhosted  wallets, will be introduced next. This is not a regulation you introduce  to then never use.
* All VASPs with operating in the US or with US clients need to be regulated in the US.

&#x200B;

## <Amendments in the Infrastructure Bill_

Last  August saw public outcry over the US Infrastructure bill. It included a  section on IRS reporting for crypto. Some highlights:

## Clarification of Definition of Broker

It  makes sense that the tax authorities use a wide definition to cover all  possible economic activities in crypto. Section 80603 of the  Infrastructure Bill amendments the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,  provides that brokers need to report the activity of their clients to  the IRS and adds the following to the definition of broker:

*‚Äú(D)  any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly  providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf  of another person.‚Äù* (35)

## Reporting of Digital Assets

In addition, a unique wide definition of digital assets is added:

*‚Äúany  digital representation of value which is recorded on a  cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology  as specified by the Secretary.‚Äù* (36)

## Effective Date

Effective after December 31, 2023.

&#x200B;

## Interpretation Infrastructure Bill

Commotion about this bill was mainly due to the wide definitions used, which could cover all activities in the crypto space,  including mining. In response, according to an article on Bloomberg,  the U.S. treasury will shortly issue additional guidance, along the  lines of the following:

*‚ÄúOther  firms key to the nearly $2 trillion crypto market ‚Äî from developers and  miners to hardware and software providers ‚Äî won‚Äôt have any new  requirements, so long as they don‚Äôt also act as brokers, according to a  Treasury official‚Äù* (37)

At  a glance, it appears that this bill is not as invasive as originally  feared. It would also be impossible to enforce this legislation on  miners due to the nature of the technology.

In this case perhaps it would have been better if clear definitions were used of what is, and  isn‚Äôt included. Moreover, comments from ‚Äúanonymous sources at the  treasury‚Äù do not provide real regulatory clarity. This industry too easily accepts the opinions of officials as decree. But we are all,  including officials, subject to the law. Given that officials change over time, opinions and guidance are not the way forward; clear laws are needed.

# <TL;DR_

**Next to the infrastructure bill, a new bill was introduced in US Congress: the ‚ÄúDigital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act.‚Äù It is not law yet, could still be amended, and if it ever comes into effect it will likely not be this year/cycle. What it says:**

**Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks, are to be regulated as commodities. Smart-contracts taking longer to deliver than 24 hours are considered futures contracts and regulated as such.**

**Every other project and future ICO is potentially a security; guidance will be issued by CFTC/SEC. Issuers of securities are likely required to provide transparency and financial information to investors. Trade is generally restricted to regulated exchanges.**

**In addition, international anti-money laundering legislation is introduced in the US; (unauthorized) Stablecoins, privacycoins, and mixers are to be prohibited. The high-level term VASP is introduced for almost all crypto projects, possibly to facilitate more future regulations.**

**Finally, the Federal Reserve gets shocking new powers to create and distribute a central bank digital currency (CBDC), of which all transactions are recorded.**

10 things I wish someone had told me when I was learning to trade crypto,"While I consider myself an amateur trader and a small-scale investor, over the 2+ years of trading crypto I've learned some things I'd like to share with you all, but mostly with those who are making their first steps into the uncharted cryptoland. 

1. Just as with anything else in life, **trading cryptocurrencies is context dependent**. That means you should remain a healthy sceptic about general truths, universal rules and things that ""everyone knows"". Consider the famous ""buy low sell high"" dictum. The definition of high and low is subjective in most cases since it depends on your timescale, goals and trading strategy. If you‚Äôre a hodler, as are many of the fellow redditors here, your high and low will differ dramatically compared to the day trader's.

2. It is for the same reason that **bulls and bears don't really matter**. Whether you're 'bullish' or 'bearish' depends on your strategy and timescale. Consider this: to someone hodling BTC since 2013 a dip here or there (even a prolonged one) makes little difference because the price of BTC over the time continues to grow monstrously ‚Äì you can call it one long-term bull market.

3. At some point, you'll bump (or you already have) into something that is called 'technical analysis'. Let me save you some time (and money, probably) by telling you this: **technical analysis is neither technical, nor is it very analytical**. While many traders regard TA to be a scientific way (supposedly based on mathematics) to read and predict the market moves, TA has little to do with any formal science. Differently from the surrounding physical world, we are not aware of any physical laws that govern our human behavior, including markets. If it was possible to mathematically calculate and with certainty predict market moves, the big buck guys in Wall Street would have already done it. Think about the major financial crises for a moment ‚Äì just like the Spanish Inquisition, nobody (well, almost nobody) ever expected one. Does it mean TA ‚Äì  trends, chart patterns, MACD, RSI, Elliot wave count, etc. ‚Äì is a complete rubbish? I wouldn't go as far as to claim that. It is somewhat helpful ‚Äì if only a little, TA still gives you a feel of the current market mood. TA also does one other thing pretty accurately: it graphically represents historic data of human behavior in the financial markets. Surely you can benefit from that? Or do you? This brings me to another point...

4. **Beware of historical analogies and 'I knew it all along' thing**. As humans, we are prone to hindsight bias, a tendency, after an event has occurred, to see it as having been easily predictable. We are all blinded by hindsight bias because our brain looks for simplistic linear link between cause and effect. This way when an unexpected event happens, the brain uses the knew-it-all-along mode to cope with cognitive dissonance and make sense of the surrounding world. While trading hindsight bias harms you in two ways: a) it drains you psychologically for not making 'the right' decisions in the past, and by luring you into oversimplified historic analogies, b) it creates a false sense of investment security at the present time. Just look at everyone complaining they've sold their BTC at the worst possible time (as a matter of fact, I am no different ‚Äì I still autodestructively loathe my decision to liquidate a large portion of my BTC portfolio after the BTC price hiked to 8k). It is also very tempting to think you wouldn't miss 'the next bitcoin'. The problem is, though, that it is incredibly difficult if at all possible to spot such an opportunity. You have to be either lucky or extremely well informed (and lucky) to capitalize early on such opportunity. In reality, it's very difficult to differentiate between useless information (noise) and something that truly matters (signal). Which brings me yet to another point...

5. **Stop being a news junkie and start filtering what you read/hear/see**. If you don't, at some point in time the quantity of consumed news will start to impact your decisions and it will begin to negatively correlate with the net gain of your investment portfolio. Instead of reading news nonstop, better educate yourself ‚Äì dive deep into the market fundamentals and the technology you're dealing with. This way it will be easier for you to spot new lucrative investment opportunities when the time comes.

6. **Accept the fact that idiots also happen to make lots of money and move on**. Multiple times too, if they're lucky ones. However, the net worth of (lucky) idiot doesn't mean you should imitate him and become one. Some two months ago a Dutch father of two young children sold his family's house, bought BTC and other cryptocurrencies, and relocated his family to a rented property. After the recent spike in BTC price the guy's net worth must have increased substantially. So, is he an idiot? Absolutely! It is only a question of time before he ruins his own and his family's life with some incredibly reckless financial decision.

7. **Try to understand the motives governing your decisions and act (or don't act) accordingly**. If your actions are about to be driven by extreme emotions such as fear, panic or excitement ‚Äì stop immediately and reevaluate the situation. Otherwise you'll end up belonging to the FOMO buyer/panic seller club aka the money losers. If you want to stay on the earning side long term, you must keep your head cool and think clearly.

8. **Day trading is probably not for you**. Consider this: evidence in neuroscience research shows that we are a loss-averse species. For this we should thank our stone age ancestors who had barely enough food, shelter and belongings to survive in a very adverse world. Losing even a little of what they had meant their existence was in jeopardy. This explains why contemporary humans prefer avoiding financial loss to making financial gain. Neuroscientists claim that losing money activates the same area of the brain that responds to mortal danger. This is why in order to do day trading you must have A LOT of self-control and balls of steel ‚Äì there are many ups and downs during a single day. It drains you emotionally, you end up being addicted to adrenaline, your fianc√©e hates it, and the hodlers will probably outperform you in the long run anyway.

9. **Volatility is your friend**. Over time BTC volatility makes the coin stronger, not weaker. While wild swings in price makes BTC almost impossible to use as a currency, volatility is good from the financial asset point of view. Traders and investors dealing with BTC get used to huge and sudden price hikes and dips. Unlike for any 'stable' stock of any prominent multinational corporation, even substantial and unexpected shocks will not undermine the confidence in BTC. BTW, best of luck to everyone planning to short BTC. :)

10. **Make small mistakes, learn from them, get wiser, err less**. In your childhood days, you needed the experience of burning your hand with fire so that for the rest of your life you wouldn't need to think about the painful experience. That information is now hardwired in your brain and helps you to avoid getting harmed. If you've just started trading crypto, expect to make mistakes and prepare to learn from them. It's only after you get into FOMO, get panicked big time, take too big a risk, get out too early only to jump in at the worst possible time, ONLY and ONLY then you'll start to improve.

Ted Cruz seeks repeal of Biden infrastructure bill's crypto broker definition@ Michael McSweeney," 

Texas Senator Ted Cruz is seeking to strip language defining who is a crypto ""broker"" from a multibillion-dollar infrastructure package that was just signed into law.¬†

According to a [statement](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-infrastructure-bills-devastating-attack-on-emerging-cryptocurrency-industry) from Cruz's office, [the proposed legislation](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/20211115.cryptobill.pdf) would, if passed, remove language aimed at tightening reporting requirements for ""brokers"" in the digital asset space. The legislation mirrors an [earlier attempt](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/113707/sen-portman-throws-support-behind-amendment-to-his-crypto-provision-in-infrastructure-bill) by Cruz to eliminate the language from the infrastructure package in August, as previously reported.¬†

The original inclusion triggered a raft of efforts by crypto industry advocates to either amend or remove the language, though these efforts ultimately failed. The infrastructure package was signed into law Monday by US president Joe Biden. Supporters of the definitions have said the expanded definition would help provide funding for the infrastructure package.¬†

Notably, some of the other senators involved in the pushback [have proposed their own legislation](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/124388/senators-wyden-and-lummis-to-introduce-crypto-amendment-to-bidens-infrastructure-bill) that would revise some of those rules.¬†

By contrast, Cruz is once again trying to cut the provisions entirely.

""As a deliberative body, the Senate should have done its job and held hearings to properly understand the consequences of legislating on this emerging industry before we risked the livelihoods and privacy of participating Americans,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""I urge my colleagues in the Senate to repeal this harmful language that will create regulatory uncertainty and in turn an unnecessary barrier to innovation.""",Ok_Soft_744,1637114547.0,1923,Bitcoin

*Must read for newcomers* My friend worked in the Bitcoin industry (broker) for a couple of years and has been involved in the crypto world since 2014. This is what he had to say about the recent politics of btc when someone asked him on our crypto trading channel,"(He first sent this article https://medium.com/@StopAndDecrypt/thats-not-bitcoin-this-is-bitcoin-95f05a6fd6c2, then followed up with this reply when someone told him he had no idea what he just read)

""There was a big scaling debate and in the end there were two sides. Those that wanted to scale using bigger blocksize (short term solution that doesn't work long term and also causes more centralization) vs those who wanted to scale using changes in the code to make the network more efficient aka SEGWIT+second layer scaling solutions (bitcoin becomes massive settlement layer, and second layer solutions can take care of verifying your $3.25 coffee payment). 

On the big block side you had (most) miners because they were only able to see the short term benefits of increased blocksize and they do not care about network centralization. Also, a chinese miner controlling a sizeable chunk of the network's hashrate had access to (and was in the process of patenting) this technology called ASICBOOST which is an exploit in bitcoin code that allows you to ""cheat"" and get extra hashing power out of your miners. Essentially they had an unfair advantage and the KEY is that the segwit upgrade fixes this exploit. Alongside these miners you had a couple of misguided (but incredibly wealthy because of early adoption) individuals who either have a reason to see bitcoin fail (like they are heavily invested in altcoins now) or they are too pigheaded to back down when wrong (or some of them I'm sure are not actually intelligent enough to understand they are wrong).

On the Segwit side you had all the core developers (the guys who worked side by side with satoshi to build all this and have been contributing to the code for years every day), the majority of the userbase, AND the vast majority of bitcoin companies. The two sides were basically arguing over who had control over bitcoin - was it the miners, or was it the users? Was it those who chose which software to run (users) or was it those who verified transactions for that software (miners)? (The answer as you will see shortly is Users). So basically these miners were stalling the upgrade because it would mean the end of their unfair (AND patented) advantage. This massive stalemate in the debate caused a community led uprising known as the User Activated Soft Fork movement (UASF). These guys basically said ""We're switching our nodes to Segwit software starting Aug 1 and we will be rejecting all mined blocks that do not comply with the new code"". This forced the miners' hand as they realized they would either be forked off the network or have to go along with the new upgrade to make sure everything continued to go smoothly (including their profits).

The movement gained enough support to freak out some big money bitcoin CEOs who got together in a room with the miners and made a deal behind closed doors known as the New York Agreement (NYA). This is where Segwit2x was born. The key to note here is that not a single core dev was invited to this meeting (in fact, not a single competent dev in general was invited). The terms of the deal were: You guys agree to implement Segwit now, and then we'll agree to an increase in block size later (November). Deal was made and obviously the majority of the user community was in an uproar because bitcoiners hate closed door deals (and they should for good reason). 

That being said, it got Segwit activated because it gave miners an easy way to safe face and go with segwit and the community instead of seeing their profits get wrecked by a messy chainsplit. However, do you remember that sneaky miner who had patented the ASICBOOST technology? Well he was part of the NYA and he decided to fork off anyway and create Bitcoin Cash. So stop right here and realize that the only reason we have bitcoin cash is so that some miner with a ton of hashing power could keep his unfair advantage over the network (he stills mainly mines bitcoin by the way because he would go out of business if he switched entirely to bitcoin cash). Also at this point, technically the NYA was broken because the whole point of it was to avoid a chainsplit and go with segwit followed by a block size increase whereas bitcoin cash was a clear chainsplit.

So for a few months everything was ok because we had Segwit, core devs were still with us, and (supposedly) anyone who wanted bigger blocks had forked off to bitcoin cash right? Wrong. See it turns out that those guys who made that backroom deal with the miners also had their own interests which involve removing the current core developers from their (imagined) seat of power. It is classic old school business politics - they don't care that core the devs are based around principles of meritocracy and peer review. They just want to have more of a say in the direction bitcoin takes. At this point, you might be thinking, ""Ok but its fair for companies who use a product to have a say in its development, right?"" NO. Not when the ""product"" at stake is meant to be an incredibly secure, incorruptible ledger that can hold trillions of dollars in wealth and still be hosted online accross the world. 

The fact is that no one understands the code better than the core developers and no one has more of an interest in seeing bitcoin stay decentralized and secure than these guys do. These guys literally cum buckets everyday to how much they love coding bitcoin. If Satoshi is Cypher Jesus then these guys are his Apostles. And on the other hand you have some severely misguided corporate buffoons who think they have the knowledge to negotiate a compromise with a group who has nothing but short term profit in their sights. And when the core developers are like ""wtf dude?"" and the community stands behind them, then these guys resort to essentially trying to kick core out of bitcoin by starting a new chain. A new chain which was based on a compromise that no one wants or needs anymore. And the excuse these CEO's are hiding behind is ""We don't want to go back on our word."" Classic business mindset vs coding mindset.

ur word."" Classic business mindset vs coding mindset. 

Now we come to the current situation where there are basically 4 sides

1. Core developers, and those supporting them
2. The (remaining) signers of the NYA and those supporting Segwit2x 
3. Malicious third parties who just want to see bitcoin fail (invested in altcoins/bitcoin cash or they are the Joker and just want to see shit burn)
4. Innocent bystanders


The core developers are continuing to code and improve bitcoin and they are working on second layer solutions. They haven't stopped development and have actually made a TON of beneficial changes to the code since the Segwit upgrade allowed them to. Being non-political or atleast being shit politicians, these guys do not know how to handle themselves with other people and either don't speak much or come off as pretentious d*bags (trust me I used to hate them before I smartened up). 

The remaining NYA signers. I say remaining because alot of companies left when they saw the massive backlash from the community. The only signers left are miners and then a group of around 30 companies which all have ties to Barry Silbert's holding company Digital Currency Group and suprise surprise who do you think got that NYA meeting together in the first place? Silly Silbert indeed. He's basically trying to do a sort of corporate take over of bitcoin where he decides who is writing the code and how they write it. Oh also I should note here that these guys have 1 developer working on the Segwit2x code. Yes 1, Jeff Garzik. Coding ability? Mediocre at best. All he did was copy and paste the entire bitcoin core code (because its open source) and changed the one little value that dictates block size. He changed a 1 to a 2 haha! And when he tried to make other changes he made critical mistakes that had to be fixed by CORE DEVELOPERS hahahaha! So how the f* does that even compare to an army of geeks who have been coding bitcoin for years and coding in general for decades who are all constantly trying to find mistakes in each others' work. SO people supporting Segwit2x are either severely misguided, hate core devs, or don't have all the information to make an informed decision.

Now the malicious actors. These are people who have a vested interest in seeing bitcoin crumble. I'm talking about big altcoin investors and bitcoin cash supporters (yes the guys who have ASICBOOST and want are the reason for this whole mess in the first place). And Segwit2x has presented them with a beautiful vector of attack. Divide and conquer. Right? And whereas with bitcoin cash there was replay protection (meaning the split was pretty clean and bitcoin was largely unaffected) this time they haven't got any planned - so should things go through as planned, things could get messy.

Then you have all those innocent bystanders who don't really know what to think anymore. Things have gotten so convoluted and complicated that it is hard to follow who wants what anymore. These are the people who will get the most fucked by something like Segwit2x because they won't understand the risks as it is happening and they won't have the knowledge to know which wallets to support. Imagine Segwit2x happens and one wallet sticks with the core version of bitcoin and the other wallet supports the segwit2x version but they both just say ""Bitcoin"".
 
That is why people are soooooooooooooo strongly opposed to Segwit2x more than anything. It is nothing more and nothing less than a hostile takeover attempt. And at this point that should be more than clear because why else would you still support the compromise made with miners who broke the compromise by creating bitcoin cash? No one wanted Segwit2x in the first place. People wanted bigger blocks, or segwit, not both. Segwit2x was never a faction in the debate. It was a faction that was spawned by those who created the NYA because they saw an opportunity take control of the software development from a group of developers who have been working on it for years and who strongly oppose corporate interests getting involved in bitcoin development.""

Fast forward a three months from April and my dad gets around asking how crypto's working for me (I knew he knew it had dropped) therefore just asking to get a good laugh at my face.
He's a nice dad and has educated me in a lot of different things but I count the days to take him on a really nice vacation all with my Bitcoin and have the final laugh at the fact he didn't stack when he had the chance. And of all things; listened at what the newer generations are here to change for the better.

Keep on hodling and don't let anyone even know about your holdings, it's just gonna beat you down to their level, don't give in and keep stacking :)",LaloMal0,1625976061.0,1434,Bitcoin

So I had an argument with my dad about Crypto,"Once in a while I think by myself ""lets give my mom and dad a visit"", since I am obviously the most favorite son of 3. So I went there to watch some football and it was all nice and fun. All of a sudden, during the commercial brake, my dad asked: ""Son, do you have money invested in Bitcoin?"". I replied ""of course I did."", knowing that he (as an old fashioned-, retired-, stock guy who likes to argue) was starting an argument about it. He started ranting on how it is just one big scam and ""all those other bitcoins"" (meaning altcoins red.) are even more so. And they have no real value or use, now or in the future. So I asked why he was thinking that, giving the fact that his statement was so absolute. The poor man based his assumption on just one (!) article in the financial times, ""and other articles"" but he couldn't clarify which ones. He also stated that he never seen any blockchain is use in practice. So I started to explain what blockchain does and what the difference is between different coins or tokens. He simply replied: ""if you believe that, than you are a believer and just as well join a church"". With those kind of arguments, you can basically never lose one.. However, long story short: don't try to be a good son, don't argue with your dad and don't cut the brakes on your dads car, you will regret it.",woodfast88,1625056252.0,1164,Bitcoin

Are The Crypto Centralized Exchanges Running Dry of #bitcoin?,"A historical decline in Bitcoin reserves on centralized exchange platforms is signaling a significant market shift. Glassnode data reveals reserves have plummeted to about 2.58 million BTC, a level unseen since 2018. This trend coincides with Bitcoin's price doubling this year, prompting questions about the rationale behind this movement.

Analysts speculate that investors are increasingly transferring their assets off exchanges to safeguard their crypto holdings instead of selling. This shift hints at a growing expectation of a substantial price upswing and a desire to protect against centralized platform volatility.

The ongoing outflows of Bitcoin from exchanges not only hint at a potential surge in demand but also underscore a broader transition towards off-exchange transactions. This shift reflects a changing mindset among Bitcoin holders, prioritizing autonomy and secure asset management in the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape.

Why Crypto Crashed Today,"My thoughts on why the entire crypto market just tanked... (tl/dr)

The people behind B cash thought that this would be the perfect time to launch a full-scale and highly coordinated attack in it's never ending attempt to become 'the one true bitcoin'. 

1) They had that idiot Swede from bitcoin.com come out and announce on every media outlet he was 'selling all his bitcoin, because it's useless'. 
2) They then began a well orchestrated FUD campaign that included paid click-farm shills posting everywhere about how Bitcoin will crash there's is the better solution... 
3) At the same time Roger, that idiot Swede and others from the Chinese mining groups who collectively hold hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of BTC began dumping just enough to steadily drop the price and reinforce their message... 
4) Add in spamming the network with fake transactions to slow things even more...while shouting ""See, we're right...""

....All timed to be within 24 hours of the Coinbase announcement. 

Clearly a well planned power play and It was clearly successful... (sort of)

Roger Vers and the Swede and the Chinese miners? They all made a shit ton of money. Maybe you did too if you got out in time so who cares right? 

You should care.... this past week was an important week for all crypto as it was the first week of real Wall Street money coming into the market with CME futures (5x bigger btw then CBOE). It was widely known that many investors would be waiting to see how things went, to see if it was too volatile, too manipulated... And guess fucking what? 

Today Ally Financial announced it has changed it's mind and won't allow its 1m+ customers to trade Bitcoin futures.... people are reading about how corrupt the crypto space is with the Coinbase insider trading scandal... and tomorrow morning they will all wake up to read about how it crashed... And they won't seperate out one coin from another... to them it's all the same and Bitcoin is the leader.

So... the truth is we will recover but make no mistake, the bullshit greed war that Roger the fucking felon started has set back the entire market as the 'institutional money; we all hoped would flood in is now saying ""No fucking way""... That and the Roger cartel dumping of BTC in an attempt to get it closer in market share is why we are tanking. 

Now go on, flame me back... I expect it..I'm happy to provide references to all of the above (or you can google it yourself). 

So realize this.. the threat to crypto is not just from governments or Wall Street or some hacker stealing your shit, it's from greed. Greed from within... 

Or maybe not. What the fuck do I know :)

"Former (and current real estate investor) tries to convince you to go qqq and crypto, real estate is dead money.","I will show why real estate is a HORRIBLE investment going forward compared to btc and crypto. I will post this in the real estate and btc forums.

1st off: I made most of my wealth through real estate and still own a rental and airbnb.

I am not your uncle Ed who will attempt to convince you real estate works because it worked for him.

Real estate works in one of the following scenarios:

1. The return on investment for a cash purpose is high relative to other investments

and/or 

has a huge upside appreciation potential.

2. The property cash flows with the minimum amount down. For example, a 500k place you put 25k down and rent it out and the rents >mortgage, taxes, fees, repairs. The investment you are getting is relatively higher than other investments.

As I said, I made most of my initial wealth in real estate through real estate appreciation.  I was the guy that put 5% down and the place went up 80% so my ROI = 80\* 1/20= 1600%. However, real estate will be in general a shitty performer GOING FORWARD for the following reasons:

40% of American real estate has no mortgages and the return on these properties relative to treasuries, let alone the stock market, are less. This means that if the house was sold and the $ put in treasuries, the return would be greater. In QQQ, way greater.

Much of American real estate is good for the CURRENT holder because taxes are a joke but the #s will not pass on to the next buyer. For example, I have a relative who has a house worth $1.8. The taxes are $1,200 a year for her. For the next buyer, they will be $1,500-A MONTH. 

A lot of real estate that is being sold by grandparents and parents will go to investments such as stocks and crypto-that's the direction of money flows for various reasons. These reasons are affordability, qualifying for mortgages, and demographics.

Demographics-the generations of 20-40 it's really clear: their need for big houses is much smaller. Many of these people will be single and or have no kids, or 1-2. The days of having 3-4 kids is getting much much more rare. The big house is not desirable.

Tenant laws: In many states, current landlords (including myself) are seeing the writing on the wall and will not invest again because the laws are not in their favor.

Long term rates: there is an idea that 30 year mortgages might not go back to 3% in a long long time UNLESS there is yield curve control. If that happens, stocks and crypto go ballistic.

Airbnb phenomena: One of the big reasons there was a final push in 2021 -2022 was that low rates made airbnbs very interesting investments. Now, the #s make zero sense.

Capitulation: be honest, how many people do you know who lost homes in 08 and/or refused to buy fearing a crash in 12,14,15,17, 20, and finally relented in 21? 

  
OTHER INVESTMENTS

Real estate investing is really about at its core appreciation or humungous cash flow. The issue is that at today's prices NEITHER works. This doesn't mean there is a crash coming. What this means is pricing will pretty much do NOTHING over the next 5 years as sellers slowly start to cut. 

The issue is that if you are a young person of say 18-24 you will see people who got rich off of real estate-I'm one of them-but what you don't understand is that because prices went so low in 2010-2017 and are so high now, they look like geniuses. But for many who are long term holders of real estate, it's good but not nearly as impressive.

Look at this chart and see the value of the guy who bought In 2006-2007 to 2019. NOTHING.

Now, look at the differences for tech stocks and even the standard sp500.

The real money is being made in secular trends: tech and crypto.

Real estate had a nice period where the people who were brave enough to buy the crash got handsomely rewarded. For example, I bought a condo for about $300k in 2013 that is now worth $600k. I put $45k down. My ROI is $300k/45k=660%. The guy I bought it from got it at a 3% mortgage for $200k.

The big issue is that now there is no upside because if you bought it today and rented it your return would be LESS than treasuries.

The secular trends will continue to attract money as conversations continue and people start to realize their houses are not investments, but in fact prisons that PREVENT THEM FROM INVESTING. 

THE BIG ISSUE IS THAT REAL ESTATE IS A BET ON TWO THINGS

printed money

lowering of rates

But, if these happen, crypto and tech go up way more

I remember as I sold my properties and borrowed against others I was called crazy. For a long time, I thought I was stupid (I still am).

However, I remember these arguments against crypto, specifically btc in general:

BTC goes up if : DXY goes down, more money printed, lower rates.

Well, rates are still high, DXY is 107, there is only a starting of $ to be printed, and it's still high.

"BIDEN TO SIGN BITCOIN, CRYPTO EXECUTIVE ORDER THIS WEEK"," 

President Joe Biden will sign an executive order this week to task federal agencies with assessing the risks and opportunities that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies bring to the U.S. and outline the government‚Äôs strategy for the market‚Äôs regulation, reported [*Bloomberg*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-07/biden-to-sign-crypto-order-as-industry-faces-sanctions-pressure?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2).

The order will direct federal agencies to examine potential regulatory changes and the national security and economic impact of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, people familiar with the administration‚Äôs plans told *Bloomberg*.  


‚ÄúThe executive order, which has been in the works since last year, will require federal agencies across the government to report later this year what they‚Äôre doing regarding digital tokens,‚Äù per the report. ‚ÄúThe plan is expected to begin carving out roles for agencies across the government, from the State Department to the Commerce Department.‚Äù

Regulatory efforts [would also involve](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/biden-administration-to-regulate-bitcoin-as-a-matter-of-national-security-report) the Treasury Department, National Economic Council, Council of Economic Advisers, and the White House National Security Council.

Bitcoin has risen to the spotlight since the U.S. and its allies began imposing restrictions on Russia in a push to isolate the country‚Äôs economy and suppress its abilities to continue marching forward in its Ukraine invasion. Despite being a [tangible alternative to Russian citizens](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/biden-imposes-sanctions-on-russia-bitcoin-jumps-to-39k) who may now find themselves unable to send and receive money freely, Bitcoin is [likely unable](https://www.btcpolicy.org/blog/no-bitcoin-wont-save-russia-from-western-sanctions) to equally help the nation bypass Western sanctions altogether.

However, U.S. lawmakers have expressed concerns regarding such a possibility, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who [sent a letter](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2022.03.01%20Letter%20to%20Treasury%20re%20OFAC%20crypto%20sanctions%20enforcement.pdf) to the Treasury Department inquiring about its plans to combat an eventual Russian usage of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.",Joyce91905,1646692836.0,597,Bitcoin

Bitfinex security breach: Trading will be halted as well as all crypto deposits/withdrawals,"Today we discovered a security breach that requires us to halt all trading on Bitfinex, as well as halt all digital token deposits to and withdrawals from Bitfinex.

We are investigating the breach to determine what happened, but we know that some of our users have had their bitcoins stolen. We are undertaking a review to determine which users have been affected by the breach. While we conduct this initial investigation and secure our environment, bitfinex.com will be taken down and the maintenance page will be left up.

The theft is being reported to‚Äîand we are co-operating with‚Äîlaw enforcement.

As we account for individualized customer losses, we may need to settle open margin positions, associated financing, and/or collateral affected by the breach. Any settlements will be at the current market prices as of 18:00 UTC. We are taking this necessary accounting step to normalize account balances with the objective of resuming operations. We will look at various options to address customer losses later in the investigation. While we are halting all operations at this time, we can confirm that the breach was limited to bitcoin wallets; the other digital tokens traded on Bitfinex are unaffected.

We will post updates as and when appropriate on our status page (Bitfinex.statuspage.io) and on the maintenance page. We are deeply concerned about this issue and we are committing every resource to try to resolve it. We ask for the community‚Äôs patience as we unravel the causes and consequences of this breach.

**Updates:** As it stands, we are continuing to investigate the hack and understand exactly how relevant systems were compromised.

Over $40k of CryptoCurrency Stolen,"I'm really devastated. Just looked at my wallet today when I was thinking of buying more bitcoin, all to to find out all my cryptocurrency is gone -- valued over $40,000. I spent years earning it and resisting pulling it out, hoping I could eventually use it to pay for college tuition.

Here are the facts:

- I have a Ledger Nano S wallet.

- That wallet had 4.77 LTC, 4.48 ETH, and 0.73 BTC.

- The Ledger generated a passphrase containing 24 words.

- I recorded that passphrase on a piece of paper and hid it.

- No one had or has access to that paper.

- That passphrase (those words) were NEVER entered anywhere. (Not even on my phone)

- On February 24th at 5:45 AM Eastern Time, the BTC was stolen.

- On the same day, at 6:46 AM and 6:48 AM, the ETH and LTC, respectively, were stolen.

- I also has a Trust Wallet.

- I had $1500 worth of NPXS and $1000 worth of TRX in that wallet.

- On February 24th at 6:48 AM and 6:55 AM both of those were stolen.

- The passphrase for the Trust Wallet is saved as a screenshot on my iPhone.

- My iPhone has not left my possession.

- My iPhone has a 6 digit passcode.

The recipient address for the BTC is: 3EP2Bq6yMpXQc3TvoxLtwDsd1tg2A59CJs

Note: Both wallets were hacked on the same day at around the same time. Both had separate passphrases.


No one has access to that paper and that the thief‚Äôs wallet address for BTC has other larger transactions. 

Did not have the 25th digit only 24 passphrase

Can someone please shed some light on what can be done, if anything? How were both wallets compromised at the same time?! If nothing can be done to retrieve the crytpo, what can be done to prevent this from happening in  the future.


Update:

Will reply to everyones as soon as I can. Have school work that I need to get done, and can‚Äôt let two things go bad.

$85k worth of crypto stolen in Peru - A cautionary tale,"I'm  not trying to make this a sad story, but I felt it was worth sharing   for the larger crypto community to be aware of, and perhaps some words  of advice as to what to do from here. I'll keep the story as short as I   can.

I was recently in Peru for a  few weeks traveling  around on vacation. It was an amazing 2.5 weeks  until the last 2 days.  On Thursday, Nov 11th I decided to spend the  last couple days of my trip  exploring Miraflores district in Lima,  Peru. Upon landing at the  airport I got a taxi cab from the airport  kiosk and started making my  way to Miraflores. No more than 2 miles  from the airport, in  bumper-to-bumper traffic, I was on my¬†iPhone  (looking up restaurants in  the area - Lima is a foodie paradise) with  the window rolled down when  all of the sudden ... snatch. Someone  walked up behind me in traffic and  stole my iPhone right out of my  hands through the window.

This is  when the nightmare scenario begins. I was initially annoyed just due to  the  fact my iPhone was stolen, and I assumed the perp was likely just  going  to try and sell it. Now I have to go through that whole mess from  Peru, and get home without a phone etc. All of the sudden it hit me ...  he  grabbed my phone while I was on it, meaning if he was able to keep  it unlocked he has access to my email, 2FA etc. By the time I had the  taxi  driver turn around and get back to the airport, approximately  30-45 mins had passed before I could get back into a wifi zone. Luckily I  had my  iPad (no data just wifi iPad), so I immediately reported my  phone as  stolen and FaceTimed a buddy to help me start closing  accounts, that's  when I saw it ... an email confirmation from Coinbase  saying ""transaction successful.""

HE  WAS IN MY CRYPTO ACCOUNTS, converting some of my holdings and  transferring them to his address. Not just that, but  as he was doing  this he was deleting my email confirmations so I could  not see what he  was doing (even going into my trash folder and perm  deleting them).  Panic set it, but it was too late. Coinbase, Binance,  and Trust wallet  (primarily Trust wallet so I don't hold much on  exchanges) all drained  and sent to his address. **$85,000**  in  holdings gone in 30 mins. He obviously knew what he was doing. This  was no joe-schmo and he was likely working with someone else. I  couldn't  believe it - an absolute¬†gut punch. I'm a relatively  tech-savvy person  (moreso than the avg person) and always implement  security measures. I have a metamask as well that he luckily did not go  for or get into, but  he probably could have if he wanted. This guy (or  multiple people) was a  pro, he knew he only had so much time. Didn't go  for my stocks or bank  accounts, only crypto, and afterwards shut the  phone down and likely  threw it in a river. I've played the scenario out  in my head a thousand  times and it's obvious they stake out that  specific area / targeting  tourists in taxi's etc. A million things had  to go right for them to  pull this off as fast and efficiently as they  did.

Additionally,  just so  everyone knows, he had my email and Google Authenticator 2FA  (which  were both obviously on my phone) so he was able to act as me.

I'm devastated. Years and years of saving and investing.

I'm   not letting this take away from my crypto investing, I'm going to get   back into it but this situation really took the wind out of my sails  and  drained me of most of my money. With that said, any method I can  follow  to try and recoup? Coinbase has been absolutely¬†no help up to  this point. Trust Wallet has been very slow to look at my case, and same  with  Binance US. Is there any other way of reporting this in hopes I  can get at least some of my investment back?¬†Any former Navy Seal  mercenaries or drone ops for hire?

Any  help  would be much appreciated and I will answer any questions to  provide further clarity if need be. Thanks, sers - can't do much but  pick myself up and get back in the saddle.

EDIT: Thank you to those who brought good advice and well wishes! Money comes and goes, and I'll be more determined to get back in the game and get it back. Hard lesson learned, and best wishes to those who learned a thing or two from my experience.

Dad got his crypto stolen - You can't protect people from themselves.,"I just need to vent right now. 

I got my dad turned onto Bitcoin and he ended up with a sizeable chunk on coinbase, right? He gets his passwords compromised at least once a year, so being the dutiful son that I am, I buy him a trezor and my wife and I help him set it up. 

He's a little upset that he can't check his balance all the time, but I assure him it's much safer in his trezor that's sitting in his closet safe than it is on coinbase.  

Fast forward to yesterday. I'm on vacation and he calls me asking why his trezor pin doesn't work. He tells me, ""it already had me put in all 24 of those damn passwords, why won't it work?"". 

I told him over and over and over when I set up his trezor and the seed phrase. ""Dad, don't type this in anywhere, don't even take a photo of it"". And what does he do the first time he tries to use his trezor himself?

I am so angry and frustrated right now it's kinda ruining my vacation. You cannot save people from themselves.

EDIT: While I appreciate the ""advice"" of all you crypto aficionados, consider this - dear old dad was supposed to leave the trezor in his safe and not touch it without me. Literally he had an index card with all the Do's, Don'ts, and all that. And sweet lord Satoshi, y'all project/assume a lot.

EDIT2: Reading all the comments, both the empathetic and the weirdly hostile/salty ones, made me feel better about the whole situation. And yeah, my immediate thought as soon as he called me was that I should have kept the seed to myself. Fuck me for trusting my old man to listen to me. Big lesson learned, and not about BTC. 

And since people have asked what exactly happened and to pass that lesson along: Afaik he tried to access his trezor and ended up on a trezor lookalike site that prompted him to put in his recovery seed. I don't know much beyond that right now.",Cackling_Crow,1622060374.0,460,Bitcoin
